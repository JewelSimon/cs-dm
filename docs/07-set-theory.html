<h1>7. Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Modern mathematics is largely founded on set theory: in particular, on
what is called <em>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of Choice</em>,
or <em>ZFC</em>. Every concept you have ever learned in mathematics can, in
principle, be reduced to expresions involving sets.  For example,
every natural number can be represented as a set: zero as the <em>empty
set, {}</em>; one as the set containing the empty set, <em>{{}}</em>; two as the
set that contains that set, <em>{{{}}}</em>; ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Set theory includes the treatment of sets, including the special cases
of relations (sets of tuples), functions (<em>single-valued</em> relations),
sequences (functions from natural numbers to elements), and other such
concepts.  ZFC is a widely accepted <em>formal foundation</em> for modern
mathematics: a set of axioms that describe properties of sets, from
which all the rest of mathematics can be deduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="naive-set-theory">
<h2>7.1. Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So what is a set? A <em>naive</em> definition (which will actually be good
enough for our purposes and for most of practical computer science) is
that a set is just an unordered collection of elements. In principle,
these elements are themselves reducible to sets but we don’t need to
think in such reductionist terms. We can think about a set of natural
numbers, for example, without having to think of each number as itself
being some weird kind of set.</p>
<p>In practice, we just think sets as unordered collections of elements
of some kind, where any given element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> any
given set. An object can be a member of many different sets, but can
only by in any give set zero or one times. Membership is binary.  So,
for example, when we combine (take the <em>union</em> of) two sets, each of
which contains some common element, the resulting combined set will
have that element as a member, but it won’t have it twice.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces <em>naive</em>, which is to say <em>intuitive and
practical</em>, set theory. It does not cover <em>axiomatic</em> set theory, in
which every concept is ultimately reduced to a set of logical axioms
that define what precisely it means to be a set and what operations
can be use to manipulate sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overly-naive-set-theory">
<h2>7.2. Overly Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#overly-naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we go on, however, we review a bit of history to understand
that an overly naive view of sets can lead to logical contradictions
that make such a theory useless as a foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the founders of modern logic, Gotlob Frege, had as his central
aim to establish logical foundations for all of mathematics: to show
that everything could be reduced to a set of axioms, or propositions
accepted without question, from which all other mathematical truths
could be deduced.  The concept of a set was central to his effort. His
logic therefore allowed one to define sets as collections of elements
that satisfy given propositions, and to talk about whether any given
element is in a particular set of not. Frege’s notion of sets, in
turn, traced back to the work of Georg Cantor.</p>
<p>But then, boom! In 1903, the British analytical philosopher, Bertrand
Russell, published a paper presenting a terrible paradox in Frege’s
conception. Russell showed that a logic involving naive set theory
would be <em>inconsistent</em> (self-contradicting) and there useless as a
foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>To see the problem, one consider the set, <em>S</em>, of all sets that do not
contain themselves. In <em>set comprehension</em> notation, we would write
this set as <img class="math" src="_images/math/534ac8167c1ad579645a52bc3e324dc570331e10.png" alt="S = \{ a: set | a \notin a \}."/> That is, <em>S</em> is the
set of elements, <em>a</em>, each a set, such that <em>a</em> is not a member of
itself.</p>
<p>Now ask the decisive question: Does <em>S</em> contain itself?</p>
<p>Let’s adopt a notation, <em>C(S)</em>, to represent the proposition that <em>S</em>
contains itself. Now suppose that <em>C(S)</em> is true, i.e., that <em>S</em> does
contain itself. In this case, <em>S</em>, being a set that contains itself,
cannot be a member of <em>S</em>, because we just defined <em>S</em> to be the set
of sets that do <em>not</em> contain themselves. So, the assumption that <em>S</em>
contains itself leads to the conclusion that <em>S</em> does not contain
itself. In logical terms, <img class="math" src="_images/math/adf9ac46080e857699cc8f5aa7c10e46bcc228fb.png" alt="C(S) \rightarrow \neg C(S)."/> This is
a contradiction and thus a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Now suppose <em>S</em> does not contain itself: <img class="math" src="_images/math/6a1221ea92c335e5d9a0d4b0911c0857bd57ae1f.png" alt="\neg C(S)."/>. Being
such a set, and given that <em>S</em> is the set of sets that do not contain
themselves, it must now be in <em>S</em>. So <img class="math" src="_images/math/17d93e6cf711e6d241441881dac0a10853d97bc8.png" alt="\neg C(S) \rightarrow
C(S)."/> The assumption that it does <em>not</em> contain itself leads right
back to the conclusion that it <em>does</em> contain itself. Either the set
does or does not contain itself, but assuming either case leads to a
contradictory conclusion. All is lost!</p>
<p>That such an internal self-contradiction can arise in such a simple
way (or at all) is a complete disaster for any logic. The whole point
of a logic is that it gives one a way to reason that is sound, which
means that from true premises one can never reach a contradictory
conclusion. If something that is impossible can be proved to be true
in a given theory, then anything at all can be proved to be true, and
the whole notion of truth just collapses into meaninglessness. As soon
as Frege saw Russell’s Paradox, he knew that that was <em>game over</em> for
his profound attempt to base mathematics on a logic grounded in his
(Cantor’s) naive notion of sets.</p>
<p>Two solutions were eventually devised. Russell introduced a notion of
<em>types</em>, as opposed to sets, per se, as a foundation for mathematics.
The basic idea is that one can have elements of a certain <em>type</em>; then
sets of elements of that type, forming a new type; then sets of sets
elements of that type, forming yet another type; but one cannot even
talk about a set containing (or not containing) itself, because sets
can only contain elements of types lower in the type hierarchy.</p>
<p>The concept of types developed by Russell lead indirectly to modern
type theory, which remains an area of very active exploration in both
computer science and pure mathematics. Type theory is being explored
as an alternative foundation for mathematics, and is at the very heart
of a great deal of work going on in the areas of programming language
design and formal software specification and verification.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zermelo repaired the paradox by adjusting some of
the axioms of set theory, to arrive at the starting point of what has
become ZFC. When we work in set theory today, whether with a <em>naive</em>
perspective or not, we are usually working in a set theory the logical
basic of which is ZFC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sets">
<h2>7.3. Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For our purposes, the <em>naive</em> notion of sets will be good enough. We
will take a <em>set</em> to be an unordered finite or infinite collection of
<em>elements</em>. An element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> a set, and can be in
a set at most once.  In this chapter, we will not encounter any of the
bizarre issues that Russell and others had to consider at the start of
the 20th century.</p>
<p>What we will find is that set-theory is a powerful intellectual tool
for the computer scientist and software engineer. It’s at the heart of
program specification and verification, algorithm design and analysis,
theory of computing, among other areas in computer science. Moreover,
Dafny makes set theory fun by making it runnable. The logic of Dafny,
for writing assertions, pre- and post-conditions, and invariants <em>is</em>
set theory, a first-order predicate logic with set and set operators
built in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-theory-notations">
<h2>7.4. Set Theory Notations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory-notations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="display-notation">
<h3>7.4.1. Display notation<a class="headerlink" href="#display-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In everyday mathematical writing, and in Dafny, we denote small sets by
listing the elements of the set within curly brace. If <em>S</em> is the set
containing the numbers, one, two, and three, for example, we can write
<em>S</em> as <img class="math" src="_images/math/4c31e27b476d112a8019c414ff007f63004cf595.png" alt="\{ 1, 2, 3 \}."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, we would write almost the same thing.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S:set&lt;int&gt; := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code introduces the variable, <em>S</em>, declares that its type is
<em>finite set of integer</em> (<em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em> being the type of <em>infinite</em> sets
of elements of tyep <em>T</em>), and assigns to <em>S</em> the set value, <img class="math" src="_images/math/1977eef35e1a05310c2317c2675f929c82acd383.png" alt="\{
1, 2, 3 \}."/> Because the value on the right side of the assignment
operator, is evidently a set of integers, Dafny will infer the type of
<em>S</em>, and the explicit type declaration can therefore be omitted.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When a set is finite but too large to write down easily as a list of
elements, but when it has a regular structure, mathematicians often
denote such a set using an elipsis. For example, a set, <em>S</em>, of even
natural numbers from zero to one hundred could be written like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/8127c272b758ea605ff9ed29db2545e371210812.png" alt="S = \{ 0, 2, 4, \ldots, 100 \}."/> This expression is a kind of
quasi-formal mathematics. It’s mostly formal but leaves details that
an educated person should be able to infer to the human reader.</p>
<p>It is not (currently) possible to write such expressions in Dafny.
Dafny does not try to fill in missing details in specifications. A
system that does do such a thing might make a good research project.
On the other hand, ordinary mathematical writing as well as Dafny do
have ways to precisely specify sets, including even infinite sets, in
very concise ways, using what is called <em>set comprehension</em> or <em>set
builder</em> notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-comprehension-notation">
<h3>7.4.2. Set comprehension notation<a class="headerlink" href="#set-comprehension-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Take the example of the set, <em>T</em>, of even numbers from zero to fifty,
inclusive. We can denote this set precisely in mathematical writing as
<img class="math" src="_images/math/4cf068c45b8ab150909db0b734b213c29a2e7c35.png" alt="T = \{ n: {\mathbb Z}~|~0 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 \land n~mod~2 = 0 \}."/>
Let’s pull this expression apart.</p>
<p>The set expression, to the right of the first equals sign, can be read
in three parts. The vertical bar in the middle is pronounced, <em>such
that</em>. To the left of the bar is an expression identifying the larger
set from which the elements of the set being defined are drawn: here
we are drawing values from the set of all integers. A name, here <em>n</em>,
is given to an arbitrary element of this source set. This name is then
used in writing a predicate that that defines which elements of the
source set are included in the set being defined. That expression is
written to the right of the vertical bar. Here the predicate is that
<em>n</em> is greater than or equal to zero, less than or equal to fifty, and
even (in that the remainder is zero when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>2</em>).</p>
<p>The overall set comprehension expression is thus read as, <em>T</em> is the
set of integers, <em>n</em>, such that <em>n</em> is greater than or equal to zero,
less than or equal to 50, and evenly divisible by <em>2</em>. A more fluent
reading would simply be “<em>T</em> is the set of even integers between zero
and fifty, inclusive.”</p>
<p>Dafny supports set comprehension notations. This same set would be
written as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>set t: int | 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 50 &amp;&amp; t % 2 == 0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that this expression evaluates to a value of type “set of int*.
You could assign this value to a variable in a Dafny method by writing</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>T := set t: int | 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 50 &amp;&amp; t % 2 == 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can think of this expression as either pure mathematics, or as a
program that <em>loops</em> over the integers, selects those that make the
given predicate evaluate to <em>true</em>, and includes all and only the
selected elements in the set being defined. That not how it actually
works (it’s not possible to actually loop over all integers), but it
is as if this is what’s happening “under the hood.”</p>
<p>There are other way to define the same set using set comprehension
notation. For example, we can define the set as the set of values of
the expression <em>2*n</em>, where <em>n</em> is in the range zero to twentyfive.
Where it’s readily inferred, mathematicians will usually also leave
out explicit type information. Here’s what it looks like: <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>T = { 2 *
n | 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 25 }.</p>
<p>In this expression one infers, based on one’s mathematical intuition,
that <em>n</em> is intended ranges over the integers or natural numbers. The
predicate on the right selects the values from zero to twentyfive. The
expression before the bar then <em>builds</em> the values in the set that is
being defined by evaluating the given expression for each value of <em>n</em>
selected from the source set. Set comprehension notation is sometimes
called <em>set builder</em> notation, and here you can see why.</p>
<p>As an aside, we note that practicing mathematicians are usually a bit
imprecise in writing math, assuming that the reader will be able to
fill in missing details.  Of course, such assumptions are sometimes
wrong. This course and book show that it is possible, using tools like
Dafny and Lean, not only to be formally precise, with tools checking
that you haven’t made mistakes.</p>
<p>Dafny supports set builder notation. To express our set in Dafny we
could also write this expression:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>set t: int | 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 25 :: 2 * t
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To read this code, you could say, “the set of values of type integer
obtained by first allowing <em>t</em> to range over values from zero to
twentyfive any by then multiplying each such <em>t</em> value by 2.”</p>
<p>The source set need not be a built-in type. Given that <em>T</em> is the set
of even numbers from zero to fifty, we can define the subset of <em>T</em> of
elements that are less than <em>25</em> using a set comprehension. In pure
mathematical writing, we could write <img class="math" src="_images/math/7ff4763ec2ebade377f3d127417577b6c7ab6d17.png" alt="S = \{ t | t \in T \land t
&lt; 25\}."/> That is, <em>S</em> is the set of elements that are in <em>T</em> (the set
of even numbers from zero to fifty) and that are less than <em>25</em>.  Here
is a Dafny command assigning this set to the variable, <em>S</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := set s | s in T &amp;&amp; s &lt; 25;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code defines <em>S</em> to be the set of integers, <em>s</em> (Dafny infers
that the type of <em>s</em> is <em>int</em>) such that <em>s</em> is in the set <em>T</em> (that
we just defined) and <em>s</em> is also less than <em>25</em>. <em>S</em> is thus assigned
the set of even integers from zero to twentyfour.</p>
<p>As a final example, let’s suppose that we want to define the set of
all ordered pairs whose first elements are from <em>S</em> and whose second
elements are from <em>T</em>, as we’ve defined them here. For example, the
pair <em>(24,76)</em> would be in this set, but not <em>(76,24)</em>. In ordinary
mathematical writing, we’d write a set builder expression like this
<img class="math" src="_images/math/3ec746aaf53e5f892c870a2e80ee49769be91a93.png" alt="\{ (s,t) | s \in S \land t \in T\}."/> This is read, “the set of
ordered pairs, <em>(s,t)</em>, where <em>s</em> is any element of <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is any
element of <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In Danfy, this would be written using set builder notation, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var Q := set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s, t);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code assigns to the new variable, <em>Q</em>, a set formed by taking
elements, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>,, such that <em>s</em> is in <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is in <em>T</em>, and
forming the elements of the new set as tuples, <em>(s, t)</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-empty-set">
<h3>7.4.3. The Empty Set<a class="headerlink" href="#the-empty-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The empty set (of elements of some type, <em>A</em>) is the set containing no
elements. In mathematical writing and in Dafny, this set is denoted as
<em>{}</em>.</p>

<h2>7.5. Set Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="cardinality">
<h3>7.5.1. Cardinality<a class="headerlink" href="#cardinality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By the cardinality of a set, <em>S</em>, we mean the number of elements
in S. When <em>S</em> is finite, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is a natural number.
The cardinarily of the empty set is zero, for example, because it has
no (zero) elements. In ordinary mathematics, if <em>S</em> is a finite set,
then its cardinality is denoted as <img class="math" src="_images/math/de6d264d4d835f6a281e7f724a7ad5d11935904e.png" alt="|S|"/>. With <em>S</em> defined as in
the preceding section, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is <em>13</em>, in that there
are thirteen even numbers between <em>0</em> and <em>25</em>.</p>
<p>The Dafny notation for set cardinality is just the same. The following
code will print the cardinality of <em>S</em>, for example.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print |S|;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a set is infinite in size, as for example is the set of natural
numbers, the cardinality of the set is not a natural number. One has
entered the realm of <em>transfinite numbers</em>. We discuss transfinite
numbers later in this course. In Dafny, as you might expect, the
cardinality operator is not defined for infinite sets (of type
<em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equality">
<h3>7.5.2. Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are said to be <em>equal</em> if and only if they
contain exactly the same elements. That is, <img class="math" src="_images/math/bf9d5c5c7dacb29bfa2721e2d4951e7b335baca1.png" alt="S = T \iff \forall
x, x \in S \iff x\in T."/> In mathematical English, you would say, “A
set <em>S</em> is equal to a set <em>T</em> if and only if for every possible value,
<em>x</em>, <em>x</em> is in S if and only if it is in <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, you could define a
polymorphic set equality operator like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>predicate set_eq&lt;A(!new)&gt;(S: set&lt;A&gt;, T: set&lt;A&gt;)
{</p>
<blockquote>
<div>forall x :: x in S &lt;==&gt; x in T</div></blockquote>
<p>}</p>
<p>This Dafny code defines a predicate, which is to say a proposition
with two parameters, S and T, each sets containing elements of type A,
where A is any Dafny type.  It looks like the mathematical definition
except for the annotation, (!new), after the declaration of the type
parameter.</p>
<p>All that said, we don’t need to define our own set equality operator,
as the one that is built into Dafny will do just fine. The proposition
that Dafny sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, are equal would be written, <em>S == T</em>.
This expression uses Dafny’s Boolean operator, <em>==</em>, for comparing
values for equality. The expression, <em>S == T</em> evalutes to true if and
only if <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are equal, as defined here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subset">
<h3>7.5.3. Subset<a class="headerlink" href="#subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A set, <em>T</em>, can be said to be a subset of a set <em>S</em> if and only if
every element in <em>S</em> is also in <em>T</em>. In this case, mathematicians
write <img class="math" src="_images/math/7333b871ac1dabeb128b8e52fb3cf50f998ac2a9.png" alt="S \subseteq T"/>. The mathematical definition is that
<img class="math" src="_images/math/2583eb91bb0510d3bada17257f0b2db36c1339a2.png" alt="S \subseteq T \iff \forall s \in S, s \in T"/>. That is, <em>S</em> is a
subset of <em>T</em> if and only if every element in <em>S</em> is also in <em>T</em>.  An
equivalent way to write it is, <img class="math" src="_images/math/ce29d951568bcb8e6cc4fac7e05713777b679c30.png" alt="S \subseteq T \iff \forall s, s
\in S \rightarrow s \in T"/>. That is, <em>S</em> is a subset of <em>T</em> if for
every value, <em>s</em>, if <em>s</em> is in <em>S</em> then <em>s</em> is also in <em>T</em>, Note that
this does not say that every element of S is in T, but only that <em>if</em>
an element is in <em>S</em> then it is also in <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s how this definition would be written in Dafny.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>predicate set_subseteq&lt;A(!new)&gt;(S: set&lt;A&gt;, T: set&lt;A&gt;)
{</p>
<blockquote>
<div>forall s :: s in S ==&gt; s in T</div></blockquote>
<p>}</p>
<p>Dafny provides a built-in subset operator, <em>&lt;=</em>. It looks like the
usual “less than or equals” operator, but when applied to sets, as in
the expression, <em>S &lt;= T</em>, it returns true if and only if <em>S</em> is a
subset of <em>T</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proper-subset">
<h3>7.5.4. Proper Subset<a class="headerlink" href="#proper-subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A set <em>S</em>, is said to be a <em>proper</em> subset of <em>T</em>, if <em>S</em> is a subset
of <em>T</em> but there is some element in <em>T</em> that is not in <em>S</em>. In our
example, <em>S</em>, the set of even natural numbers less than <em>25</em>, is a
proper subset of <em>T</em>, the set of even natural numbers less than or
equal to <em>100</em>.</p>
<p>In the language of mathematical logic, we would write, <img class="math" src="_images/math/2ea6e8f256a2b9dc720be2dea52614247d2949df.png" alt="S

<img class="math" src="_images/math/6efaa7de11dee81a9211f43b5d150191e513edb5.png" alt="S \subsetneq T"/>.</p>
<p>To futher clarify, <em>S</em> is said to be a <em>proper</em> subset of <em>T</em> if <em>S</em>
is a subset of <em>T</em> and there is at least one element in <em>T</em> that is
not in <em>S</em>.  In mathematical language, <img class="math" src="_images/math/e8ad5ed2c2ce89fed56a8b618bc5c4acf16b7b74.png" alt="S \subset T \iff \forall
s \in S, s \in T \land \exists t \in T, t \notin S"/>. The backwards
<em>E</em>, <img class="math" src="_images/math/4b5ad24000adcb52f2505ea60d39407831962012.png" alt="exists"/>, is the <em>existential quantifier</em> in predicate
logic, and is read as, and means, <em>there exists.</em> You this pronounce
this sentence as, “<em>S</em> is a proper subset of <em>T</em> if and only if every
element in <em>S</em> is in <em>T</em> and there <em>exists</em> some element in <em>T</em> that
is not in <em>S</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>predicate set_subset&lt;A(!new)&gt;(S: set&lt;A&gt;, T: set&lt;A&gt;)
{
    forall s :: s in S ==&gt; s in T &amp;&amp; (exists t :: t in T &amp;&amp; t !in S)
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The parentheses in around the exists clause aren’t needed but are
included to make it clear how to read, or <em>parse</em>, the expression.</p>
<p>We don’t really have to define our own proper subset operator in
Dafny, as Dafny provides one that is built-in. The Dafny expression,
<em>S &lt; T</em> returns true if and only if <em>S</em> is a proper subset of <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of code in Dafny. They assume that The first two of the following
assertions are thus both true in Dafny, but the third is not. That
said, limitations in the Dafny verifier make it hard for Dafny to see
the truth of such assertions without help. We will not discuss how to
provide such help at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert S &lt; T;
assert S &lt;= T;
assert T &lt;= S;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We note every set is a subset, but not a proper subset, of
itself. It’s also the case that the empty set is a subset of every
set, in that <em>all</em> elements in the empty set are in any other set,
because there are none. In logic-speak, we’d say <em>a universally
quantified proposition over an empty set is trivially true.</em></p>
<p>If we reverse the operator, we get the notion of supersets and proper
supersets. If <em>T</em> is a subset of <em>S</em>, then <em>S</em> is a superset of <em>T</em>,
written, <img class="math" src="_images/math/ebf153b4466e3e383efe1ff8204420d907956bf9.png" alt="S \supseteq T"/>. If <em>T</em> is a proper subset of <em>S</em> then
<em>S</em> is a proper superset of <em>T</em>, written <img class="math" src="_images/math/9aa51b324975554da11bbc719bbd1f0064694aa3.png" alt="S \supset T"/>. In
Dafny, the greater than and greater than or equals operator are used
to denote proper superset and superset relationships between sets.
So, for example, <em>S &gt;= T</em> is the assertion that <em>S</em> is a superset of
<em>T</em>. Note that every set is a superset of itself, but never a proper
superset of itself, and every set is a superset of the empty set.</p>

<div class="section" id="intersection">
<h3>7.5.5. Intersection<a class="headerlink" href="#intersection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The intersection of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, written as <img class="math" src="_images/math/6a6d61ecc809c85d65539fae9656f6ec1f767dc2.png" alt="S \cap

speaking, <img class="math" src="_images/math/ffd81e4b2127bdf790dfdd92ea37f28124dd1cba.png" alt="S \cap T = \{ e~|~e \in S \land e \in T \}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, we could define our own polymorphic set intersection
function in only a superficially different way as follows:</p>
<p>Once again, we don’t have to write such code. Dafny’s built-in <em>*</em>
operator applied to sets denotes set intersection.  The intersection
of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is written <em>S * T</em>. For example, the command <em>Q := S
* T</em> assigns the intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the value of <em>Q</em>. Try
it yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="union">
<h3>7.5.6. Union<a class="headerlink" href="#union" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The union of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, written as <img class="math" src="_images/math/2de920c1d2b76dfdac8638bf2aee04a1f86d4eef.png" alt="S \cup T"/>, is
the set of elements that are in either (or both) <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. That is,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/1c42020e093dd95fe74495cba4d516420eaf4c11.png" alt="S \cup T = \{ e~|~e \in S \lor e \in T \}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, we would hope to write this as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> function union&lt;A&gt;(S: set&lt;A&gt;, T: set&lt;A&gt;): set&lt;A&gt;
{
    set e | e in S || e in T
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Dafny rejects this definition. It’s not that the
definition is wrong, but rather that the implementation of Dafny is
incomplete as of the writing of this chapter. As a result, Dafny
complains that it cannot determine that the union of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is
finite, even though it clearly is, as <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> themselves are, and
a union of finite sets if clearly also finite. We will have to wait
for certain enhancements to Dafny to be able to write this code.</p>
<p>Fortunately, once again, of course, Dafny provides a built-in operator
for computing set unions, namely <em>+</em>.  The union of sets, <em>S</em> and
<em>T</em>, is written <em>S + T</em>. For example, the command <em>V := S + T</em>
assigns the union of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the new value of <em>V</em>. Try it!</p>

<div class="section" id="difference">
<h3>7.5.7. Difference<a class="headerlink" href="#difference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difference of sets <em>T</em> and <em>S</em>, written <img class="math" src="_images/math/4992211065e43e7ec68c1363b8fb99d28bbece7b.png" alt="T \setminus S"/>, is
the set of elements in <em>T</em> that are not in <em>S</em>. Thus, <img class="math" src="_images/math/f9f0d10780a702674a6d8ee8b49136ffa9f7e51f.png" alt="T
\setminus S = \{e~|~e \in T \land e \notin S)"/>.</p>
<p>We could write a Dafny function to specify this operation as follows:</p>

     set e | e in T &amp;&amp; e !in S
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, we don’t have to. In Dafny, the minus sign is used to denote
set difference, as in the expression, <em>T - S</em>. Operators in Dafny can
be applied to sets to make up more complex expressions. So, for
example, <em>|T-S|</em> denotes the cardinality of <em>T-S</em>. Try evaluating this
expression with <em>T</em> and <em>S</em> as defined in the previous section.</p>

<div class="section" id="product-set">
<h3>7.5.8. Product Set<a class="headerlink" href="#product-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The product set, <img class="math" src="_images/math/1acb93609f9c3ced3ac62508151f822cee4b46bc.png" alt="S \times T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and T*, is
defined ot be set of all the ordered pairs, <em>(s,t)</em>, that can be
formed by taking any element, <em>s</em>, from <em>S</em>, and any element, <em>t</em>,

T \}"/>.</p>
<p>There actually is no built in product set operator, in Dafny. The
good news is that you now know how to express the concept using a
set comprehension.</p>
<p>The product set of two sets can be expressed using set comprehension
notation: <em>set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s,t)</em>. The keyword, <em>set</em>,
is followed by the names of the variables that will be used to form
the set comprehension expression, followed by a colon, followed by an
assertion that selects the values of <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> that will be included
in the result, followed by a double colon, and then, the expression
that builds the values of the set being defined: here an ordered pair,
or tuple, expression.</p>
<p>We note that the the cardinality of a product set is the product of
the cardinalities of the individual sets. Think about why this must
be true.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write and test a polymorphic function method in Dafny,
called <em>set_product&lt;A,B&gt;</em>, that, when given any two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>,
of elements of types <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, respectively, returns the product
set of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. Note that the type of elements in the resulting
set is the <em>tuple type</em>, <em>(A, B)</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tuples">
<h2>7.6. Tuples<a class="headerlink" href="#tuples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tuple is an ordered collection of elements. The type of elements in
a tuple need not all be be the same. The number of elements in a tuple
is called its <em>arity</em>. Ordered pairs are tuples of arity, <em>2</em>, for
example. A tuple of arity <em>3</em> can be called a (an ordered) <em>triple</em>.
A tuple of a larger arity, <em>n</em>, is called an <em>n-tuple</em>.  The tuple,
<em>(7, X, “house”, square_func)</em>, for example, is a <em>4-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>As is evident in this example, the elements of a tuple are in general
not of the same type, or drawn from the same sets. Here, the first
element is an integer; the second, a variable;, the third, a string;
and last, a function.</p>
<p>An <em>n</em>-tuples should be understood as values taken from a product of
<em>n</em> sets.  If <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are our sets of even numbers between zero
and one hundred, and zero and twenty four, for example, then the
ordered pair, <em>(60,24)</em> is an element of the product set <img class="math" src="_images/math/8e4b485a20a84b7f2ec8231dc0a35dc4c5100c7d.png" alt="S
\times T"/>.  The preceding <em>4</em>-tuple would have come from a product of
four sets: one of integers, one of variables, one of strings, and one
of functions.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> of a tuple is the tuple of the types of its elements. In
mathematical writing, we’d say that the tuple, <em>(-3,4)</em> is al element
of the set <img class="math" src="_images/math/7968e821678c1ff446e8287d09112436b3680edf.png" alt="{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z},"/> and if asked about
its type, most mathematicians would say <em>pair of integers</em>. In Dafny,
where types are more explicit than they usually are in quasi-formal
mathematical discourse, the type of this tuple is <em>(int, int)</em>. In
general, in both math and in Dafny, in particular, the type of a tuple
in a set product, ::<cite>S_1 times S_2 times ldots time S_n</cite>, where
the types of these sets are <img class="math" src="_images/math/3eccb40a18247a3afb7fd0a856d29c0efc279393.png" alt="T_1, \ldots, T_n"/> is <img class="math" src="_images/math/60d74cdd3e9179c740d4f155e323527982941707.png" alt="(T_1,
\ldots, T_n)"/>.</p>
<p>The elements of a tuple are sometimes called <em>fields of that tuple.
Given an *n</em>-tuple, <em>t</em>, we are often interested in working with the
value of one of its fields. We thus need a function for <em>projecting</em>
the value of a field out of a tuple. We actually think of an <em>n</em>-tuple
as coming with <em>n</em> projection functions, one for each field.</p>
<p>Projection functions are usually written using the Greek letter,
::<cite>pi</cite>, with a natural number subscript indicating which field a
given projection function ” projects”. Given a <em>4</em>-tuple, <em>t = (7, X,
“house”, square_func)</em>, we would have math::<cite>pi_0(t) = 7</cite> and
<img class="math" src="_images/math/f5dae668608a8337e4c6c132b504a7acc3c92f0b.png" alt="\pi_3(t) = square_func."/></p>
<p>The type of a projection funcion is <em>function from tuple type to field
type</em>. In general, because tuples have fields of different types, they
will also have projection functions of different types. For example,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/cfbe6151259e39775abc71d3c9405e717c6d2303.png" alt="pi_0"/> here is of type (in Dafny) <img class="math" src="_images/math/1e87ccf973ff9a9c10bbeb1ce92487edb37b972b.png" alt="(int, variable, string,
int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}"/> while <img class="math" src="_images/math/a466c2939441e38dc2f8f1ac96f1f87da7ff9967.png" alt="pi_3"/> is of
type <img class="math" src="_images/math/b346c5b20b3cbae9a0e9e8fdf5e327618f771868.png" alt="(int, variable, string, int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow
(int \rightarrow int)."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, tuples are written as they are in mathematics, as lists of
field values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.  For
example <em>t := (1, “hello”, [1,2,3])” assigns to *t</em> a <em>3-tuple</em> whose
first field has the value, <em>1</em> (of type <em>int</em>); whose second field has
the value, “hello”, a string; and whose third element is the list of
integers, <em>[2, 4, 6]</em>.</p>
<p>Projection in Dafny is accomplished using the <em>tuple</em> subscripting (as
opposed to array or list subscripting) operation. Tuple subscripting is
done by putting a dot (period) followed by an index after the tuple
expression. Here’s a little Dafny code to illustrate. It defines <em>t</em>
to be the triple, <em>(7, ‘X’, “hello”)</em> (of type <em>(int, char, string)</em>),
and then usses the <em>.0</em> and <em>.2</em> projection functions to project the
first and third elements of the tuple, which it prints. To make the
type of the tuple explicit, the final line of code declare <em>t’</em> to be
the same tuple value, but this time explicitly declares its type.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var t := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
print t.0;
print t.2;
var t&#39;: (int, char, string) := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While all of this might seem a little abstract, it’s actually simple
and very useful. Any table of data, such as a table with columns that
hold names, birthdays, and social security numbers, represents data in
a product set. Each row is a tuple. The columns correspond to the sets
from which the field values are drawn. One set is a set of names; the
second, a set birthdays; the third, a set of social security numbers.
Each row is just a particular tuple in product of these three sets,
and the table as a whole is what we call a <em>relation</em>. If you have
heard of a <em>relational database</em>, you now know what kind of data such
a system handles: tables, i.e., <em>relations</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="power-set">
<h3>7.6.1. Power Set<a class="headerlink" href="#power-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The power set of a set, <em>S</em>, denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/ecf87312a6f2328d7aaf2c7faa76bd847c4a630a.png" alt="{\mathbb P}(S),"/> is the
set of all subsets of <em>S</em>, including both the set itself and the empty
set. If <em>S = {1, 2}</em>, for example, then the powerset of <em>S</em> is the set
of sets, <em>{ {}, { 1 }, { 2 }, { 1, 2} }</em>. Note that the powerset of a
set with two elements has four elements.</p>
<p>Exercise: Before continuing, write out the elements of the powersets
of the sets, <em>{ 1, 2, 3 }</em> and <em>{ 1, 2, 3, 4 }</em>. How many elements do
these powersets have? (What are their cardinalities?) Can you guess a
formula for the cardinality of the powerset of a set with cardinality,
<em>n</em>? Can you convince yourself that this formula is always right?</p>
<p>The powerset of a set of cardinality <em>n</em> has <img class="math" src="_images/math/bc3842c422f55f3c3625d00cdb478d653523ee55.png" alt="2^n"/> elements.  To
see that this is always true, first, consider the powerset of the
empty set, then consider what happens when you increase the size of a
set by one element. Start with the empty set. The only subset of the
empty set is the empty set itself, so the powerset of the empty set
has just one element. The cardinality of the empty set is <em>0</em>. The
cardinality of its powerset is <em>1</em>. And that is the same as
<img class="math" src="_images/math/f77ff764672d37a6a1f3e3d3b4e4c1ec0cece70b.png" alt="2^0"/>. Now let’s suppose that our formula holds for any set <em>S</em>,
with cardinality <em>n</em>. What is the cardinality of a set with one more
element? Its powerset contains every set in the powerset of <em>S</em>, as
those are all subsets of the larger set. Then to each of those sets,
we can add the one new element to produce all the new subsets. We thus
have double the original number of subsets. So if the cardinality of
the powerset of <em>S</em>, of cardinality <em>n</em>, was <img class="math" src="_images/math/bc3842c422f55f3c3625d00cdb478d653523ee55.png" alt="2^n"/>, then the
cardinality of the set <em>S</em> plus one new element is <img class="math" src="_images/math/f16c8e20168feddea2e7f761e226d0c1a34ed57f.png" alt="2 * 2^n"/>,
which is <img class="math" src="_images/math/f16c8e20168feddea2e7f761e226d0c1a34ed57f.png" alt="2 * 2^n"/>. We know that the powerset of the empty set
has cardinality <em>1</em>, and from there for each element we add we double
the size of the powerset, so the formula holds for sets of any finite
size!</p>
<p>The rule holds for sets of size zero, and whenver it holds for sets of
size <em>n</em> it also holds for sets of size <em>n + 1</em>, so it must hold for
sets of every (finite) size. What we have here is an informal <em>proof
by induction</em> of the mathematical proposition, that: <img class="math" src="_images/math/f5e8fcc31419910a8f7c64120ae35fb7751e25ba.png" alt="\forall S,
|{\mathbb P}(S)| = 2^{|S|}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, there is no explicit powerset operator, but we know exactly
how to implement one of our own. The concept can be expressed in a
very elegant way using a set comprehension. The solution is simply to
say <em>the set of all sets that are subsets of a given set, *S</em>. In
mathematical notation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/182dc7ea1aeff27cae66331c159a01c89412c5dc.png" alt="{\mathbb P}(S) = { R | R \subseteq S }."/>
In Dafny it’s basically the same expression.</p>
<p>The follwing three-line program computes and prints out the powerset
of <em>S = { 1, 2, 3 }</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := { 1, 2, 3 };
var P := set R | R &lt;= S;
print P;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Exercise: Write a polymorphic function method, <em>powerset&lt;A&gt;(S: set&lt;A&gt;)
in Dafny that when given a value, *S</em>, of type set&lt;A&gt; returns its
powerset. You have to figure out the return type: think “set of sets”.</p>
