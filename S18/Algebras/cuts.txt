There are two different ways to be precise about what this
means. The first is as a function from *pairs* (2-tuples) of 
boolean argument values to boolean results. Adding parenthesis 
makes this clear.

{ ((T, T), T), ((T, F), F), ((F, T), F), ((F, F), F) }

The type of this function is (boolean, boolean) -> boolean.

The second possibility is that we have a function from boolean 
values to pairs of boolean values. Here's the set of tuples for
this function.

{ (T, (T, T)), (T, (F, F)), (F, (T, F)), (F, (F, F)) }

The type of this function is boolean ->
