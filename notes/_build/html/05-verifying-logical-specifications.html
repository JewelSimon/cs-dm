<h1>Formal Verification of Imperative Programs<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-verification-of-imperative-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we first elaborate on the idea that pure functional
programming make for mathematically clear but potentially inefficient
specifications, while imperative code makes for efficient code but is
hardly clear as to its purpose, and is thus hard to reason about. To
get the benefits of both, we use functional programming to write key
parts of specifications for imperative code, and then we use tools or
manual methods to <em>prove</em> that the imperative code does what such a
speification requires.</p>
<div class="section" id="performance-vs-understandability">
<h2>Performance vs. Understandability<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-vs-understandability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To get a clearer sense of the potential differences in performance
between a pure functional program and an imperative program that
compute the same function, and tradeoffs one makes between clarity of
intent and execution speed, consider our recursive definition of the
Fibonacci function.</p>
<p>We start off knowing that if the argument to the function, <em>n</em>, is <em>0</em>
or <em>1</em>, the value of the function for that <em>n</em> is just <em>n</em> itself.  In
other words, the sequence, <em>fib(i)</em> of <em>Fibonacci numbers indexed by
i</em>, starts with, <img class="math" src="_images/math/d6d348c9fec97ea8bbe7cf69259bfbeda3f0a86d.png" alt="[0, 1, \ldots ]"/>.  For any <em>n &gt;= 2</em>, <em>fib(n)</em>,
is the sum of the previous two values.  To compute the <em>n’th (n &gt;= 2)</em>
Fibonacci number, we can thus start with the first two, sum them up to
get the next one, then iterate this process, computing the next value
on each iteration, until we’ve got the result.</p>
<p>Footnote: by convention we index sequences starting at zero rather
than one. The first element in such a sequence thus has index <em>0</em>, the
second has index <em>1</em>, and the <em>n’th</em> has index <em>n - 1</em>. For example,
<em>fib(6)</em> refers to the <em>7th</em> Fibonacci number. You should get used to
thinking in terms of zero-indexed sequences.</p>
<p>Now consider our recursive definition, <em>fib(n)</em>. It’s <em>pure math</em>:
concise, precise, elegant.  And because we’ve written it in a
functional language, we can even run it. However, it might not give us
the performance we require. An imperative program, by constrast, is
<em>code</em>. It’s cryptic but it can be very efficient when run.</p>
<p>To get a sense of performance differences, consider the evaluation of
each of two programs to compute <em>fib(5)</em>: our functional program and
an imperative one that we will develop in this chapter.</p>
<p>Consider the imperative program. If the argument, <em>n</em>, is either zero
or one, the answer is just returned. If <em>n &gt;= 2</em> an answer has to be
computed. In this case, the program will repeatedly add together the
previous two values of the function, starting with <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, until
it computes the result for <em>n</em>.  The program returns that value.</p>
<p>For a given value of <em>n</em>, what is the cost of computing an answer?
The cost will be dominated by the work done inside the loop body; and
on each iteration of the loop, a fixed amount of work is done; so it’s
not a bad idea to use the number of loop body executions as a measure
of the cost of computing an answer for an argument, <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>So, what does it cost to compute <em>fib(5)</em>? Well, we need to execute
the loop body to compute <em>fib(i)</em> for values of <em>i</em> of <em>2, 3, 4,</em> and
<em>5</em>. It thus takes <em>4</em> loop body iterations to compute <em>fib(5)</em>. To
compute the 10th element requires that the loop body execute for <em>i</em>
in the range of <em>[2, 3, …, 10]</em>. That’s nine iterations.  It’s easy
to see that for any value of <em>n</em>, the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em> will be
<em>n-1</em> loop body iterations. We can compute the <em>100,000th</em> Fibonacci
number by running a simple loop body <em>about</em> that many times. On a
modern computer, the computation will be completed very quickly.</p>
<p>The functional program, on the other hand, is evaluated by repeated
evaluation of nested recursive function applications until base cases
are reached.  Let’s think about the cost of evaluation for increasing
values of <em>n</em> and try to see a pattern. We’ll measure computational
complexity now in terms of the number of function evaluations (rather
than loop bodies executed) required to produce a final answer.</p>
<p>To compute <em>fib(0)</em> or <em>fib(1)</em> requires just <em>1</em> function evaluation
(the first and only call to the function), as these are base cases
requiring no further recursion. To compute <em>fib(2)</em> however requires
<em>3</em> evalations of <em>fib</em>: one for each of <em>fib(1)</em> and <em>fib(0)</em> plus
the evaluation of the top-level function. The relationship between <em>n</em>
and the number of function evaluations currently looks like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/4be24e711a64e67912a041b077bec55122aa69cc.png" alt="\{ (0,1), (1,1), (2,3), ... \}."/> The first element of each pair
is <em>n</em> and the second element is the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em>.</p>
<p>What about when <em>n</em> is <em>3</em>?  Computing this requires answers for
<em>fib(2)</em>, which by the resuts we just computed costs <em>3</em> evaluations,
and for <em>fib(1)</em>, which costs <em>1</em>, for a total of <em>5</em> evaluations
including the top-level evaluation. Computing <em>fib(4)</em> requires that
we compute <em>fib(3)</em> and <em>fib(2)</em>, costing <em>5 + 3</em>, or <em>8</em> evaluations,
plus the original, top-level call, for a total of 9. For <em>fib(5)</em> we
need <em>9</em> + <em>5</em>, or <em>14</em> plus one more, making <em>15</em> evaluations.  The
relation of cost to <em>n</em> (the problem size) is now like this: <img class="math" src="_images/math/885d0a047df304051a1baadee9f89870d86db99a.png" alt="\{
(0,1), (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,9), (5, 15), ... \}."/></p>
<p>In general, the number of evaluations needed to evaluate <em>fib(i+1)</em> is
the sum of the numbers required to evaluate <em>fib(i)</em> plus the number
to evaluate <em>fib(i-1)</em> plus <em>1.</em> If we use <em>C</em> to represent the cost
function, then we could say, <img class="math" src="_images/math/e49ab712522c24e69d5c1c91f3b5fcdecd6d2b36.png" alt="C(n) = C(n-1) + C(n-2) + 1"/>. This
kind of function is called a recurrence relation, and there are clever
ways to solve such functions to determine what function <em>C</em> may be. Of
course we can also write a recursive function to compute <em>C(n)</em>, if
we need only to compute it for relatively small values of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the formula, we can quickly compute the costs to
compute <em>fib(n)</em> for numerous values of <em>n</em>. The number of evaluations
needed to compute <em>fib(6)</em> is <em>15 + 9 + 1</em>, i.e., 25. For <em>fib(7)</em>
it’s <em>41</em>.  For <em>fib(8), *67</em>; for <em>fib(9), 109</em>; for <em>fib(10), 177</em>;
and for <em>fib(11), 286</em> function evaluations.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The cost to compute the <em>n’th</em> Fibonacci number,
as measured by the number of function evaluations, using our beautiful
functional program, is growing much more quickly than <em>n</em> itself, and
indeed it is growing faster and faster as <em>n</em> increases. We would say
the cost is <em>super-linear</em>, whereas with our imperative program, the
number of loop body interations grows <em>linearly</em> in <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>How exactly does the cost of the pure functional program compare? One
thing to notice is that the cost of computing a Fibonacci element with
our functional program is related to the Fibonacci sequence itself!
The first two values in the <em>cost</em> sequence are <em>1</em> and <em>1</em>, and each
subsequence element is the sum of the previous two <em>plus 1</em>.  It’s not
exactly the Fibonacci sequence, but it turns out to grow at a very
similar rate. The Fibonacci sequence, thus also the cost of computing
it recursively, grows at what turns out to be a rate <em>exponential</em> in
<em>n</em>, with an exponent of about <em>1.6</em>. Increasing <em>n</em> by <em>1</em> doesn’t
just add a little to the cost; it almost doubles it (multiplying it by
a factor of <em>1.6</em>).</p>
<p>No matter how small the exponent (with any exponent greater than one),
exponential functions eventually grow very quickly. In the limit, any
exponential function grows faster than any polynomial no matter how
high in rank it is and no matter how large its coefficients are.</p>
<p>The exponential-in-<em>n</em> cost of our clear but inefficient functional
program grows far faster than the cost of our ugly but efficient
imperative program as we increase <em>n</em>.  For any even modestly large
value of <em>n</em> (e.g., greater than 50 or so), it will be impractical to
use the pure functional program, whereas the imperative program will
reasonably run quickly even on a small personal computer for values of
<em>n</em> well into in the millions.  What eventually slows it down is not
the number of additions that it has to do but the sizes of the numbers
that it has to add.</p>
<p>You can already see that the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em> recursively for
values of <em>n</em> larger than just ten or so is much greater than the cost
to compute it iteratively. Our mathematical/functional definition is
clear (“intellectually tractable”) but inefficient. The imperative
program, on the other hand, is efficient, but not at all transparent.
We need the latter program for practical computation. But how do we
ensure that it implements the same function that we expressed in our
elegant mathematical definition?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specification-implementation-and-verification">
<h2>Specification, Implementation, and Verification<a class="headerlink" href="#specification-implementation-and-verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We address such problems by combining a few ideas. First, we use
logic, including mathematical specifications written in part using
functional programming, to express <em>declarative</em> specifications.  Such
specification precisely define <em>what</em> a given imperative program must
compute, and in particular what results it must return as a function
of the arguements it receives, without saying <em>how</em> the computation
should be done.</p>
<p>We can use functions defined in the pure functional programming style
as parts of specifications, e.g., as giving a mathematical definition
of the <em>factorial</em> function that an imperative program will then have
to implement.</p>
<p>Second, we implement the specified program in an imperative language.
Ideally we do so in a way that supports logical reasoning about its
behavior. For example, we have to specify not only the relationship
between argument and result values that are required, but also how
loops are designed to work in our code. We then need to design loops
in ways that make it easier to explain, in formal logic, how they do
what they are meant to do.</p>
<p>Finally, we use logical proofs to <em>verify</em> that the program satisifies
its specification. Later in this course, we’ll see how to create such
proofs ourselves. For now we’ll be happy to let Dafny generate them
for us mostly automatically!</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter develops these ideas in more depth with
concrete examples.  First we explain how formal specifications in
mathematical logic for imperative programs are often organized. Next
we explore how writing imperative programs without the benefits of
specification languages and verifications tools can make it hard to
spot bugs in code. Next we enhance our implementation of the factorial
function with specifications, show how Dafny flags the bug, and fix
the program. Doing this requires that we deepen the way we understand
loops. We end with a detailed presentation of the verification of an
imperative program to compute values in the Fibonacci sequence. Given
any natural number <em>n</em>, our program must return the value of <em>fib(n)</em>,
but it must also do it efficiently.  The design and precise, logical
description of key properties of a loop is once again the heart of the
problem.  We will see how Dafny can help us to reason rigorously about
loops, and that giving it a little help enables it to reason about
them for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="declarative-input-output-specifications">
<h2>Declarative Input-Output Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#declarative-input-output-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we use mathematical logic to <em>declaratively specify</em> properties
of the behaviors that we require of programs written in <em>imperative</em>
languages. For example, we might require that, when given <em>any</em>
natural number, <em>n</em>, a program compute and return the value of the
<em>factorial</em> of <em>n</em>, the mathematical definition of which we’ve given
as <em>fact(n)</em>.  In general, we want to specify how the results returned
by an imperative program relate to the arguments on which it was run.
We call such a specification an <em>input-output</em> specification. (Here
we ignore <em>side-effect</em> behaviors such as reading from and writing
to input and output devices.)</p>
<p>Specifications about required relationships between argument values
and return results specify <em>what</em> a program must compute without
specifying how it should be done. Specifications are thus <em>abstract</em>:
they omit <em>implementation details</em>, leaving it to the programmer to
decide how best to <em>refine</em> the specification into efficient code.</p>
<p>For example we might specify that a program (1) must accept any
integer valued argument greater than or equal to zero (a piece of a
specification that we call a <em>precondition</em>), and (2) that as long as
the precondition holds, then it must return the factorial of the given
argument value (a <em>postcondition</em>).</p>
<div class="section" id="input-output-relations">
<h3>Input-Output Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#input-output-relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In purely mathematical terms, a specification of this kind defines a
<em>binary relation</em> between argument (input) and return (output) values,
and imposes on the program a requirement that whenever it is given the
first value in such an <em>input-output</em> pair, it must compute a second
(output) value so that the pair, <img class="math" src="_images/math/9e7007b18642212aa4d9de61039343b1b9b87423.png" alt="(input, output)"/>, is in the
specified relation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relations-and-functions">
<h3>Relations and Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#relations-and-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation in ordinary mathematics is just a set of pairs of
values. A function is a binary relation with at most one pair with a
given first value. A function is a <em>single-valued</em> relation. What we
often need to specify, in particular, is an input-output <em>function</em>.</p>
<p>For example, pairs in the factorial relation include <img class="math" src="_images/math/8d5089934a4e6dafe42a3a178647872ce0e7ae39.png" alt="(0,1),
(1,1), (2,2), (3,6), (4,24)"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/0f4f7855d834c15ad6f85cc5827f03a4962d7578.png" alt="(5,120)"/>, but not the pair
<img class="math" src="_images/math/c2f82a5bbb7c3901dbbe16f0095f1d4f5a18ded8.png" alt="(5,25)"/>. Some of the pairs in the Fibonacci relation include
<img class="math" src="_images/math/dd98235f46a359bfedc58a2654909fde09c0f099.png" alt="\{ (0,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (5,3)"/> and <em>(6,5)</em>. These
relations are also <em>functions</em> because there is <em>at most</em> one pair
with a given first element. Finally, these functions are also said to
be <em>total</em> because for <em>every</em> natural number, there is a pair with
that number as its first element.</p>
<p>On the other hand, square root is a <em>relation</em>, a set of pairs of real
numbers, but not a <em>function</em>, because it is not singled valued. Both
of the pairs, <img class="math" src="_images/math/1b7acb805a656ce4ef94682e2801da6877ec5377.png" alt="(4,2)"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/d07699891d863d384e38bd636bdd5b9acbb15e7a.png" alt="(4,-2)"/>, which are distinct but
have same first element, are in the relation. That is so because both
<em>2</em> and <em>-2</em> are square roots of <em>4</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="total-and-partial-functions">
<h3>Total and Partial Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#total-and-partial-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We also note that the square root relation <em>on the real numbers</em> is
what we call <em>partial</em> rather than total: in that it is not defined
for some real numbers. In particular, it is not defined for (i.e., it
does not have any pairs where the first element is) any negative real
number.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turning-partial-functions-into-total-functions">
<h3>Turning Partial Functions into Total Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#turning-partial-functions-into-total-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Partial functions and non-function relations both present problems for
programmers. Let’s first consider relations that sometimes have <em>more</em>
than one value of a given type for a given argument. What value should
a program return?</p>
<p>The square root function is a good example. Given a positive argument
there will be <em>two</em> square roots, one positive and one negative. If
the function is require to return a single number as an answer, which
one should it return?</p>
<p>There is really no good answer. Rather, the solution is usually to
change the program specification slightly. For example, rather than
promising to return <em>the</em> square root (a concept that is not well
defined when there are two square roots for the same number) such a
program might promise to return the non-negative square root, of which
there is always just one (given a non-negative argument. What we have
done here is to implement a different relation, and one that is now
also a function.</p>
<p>A different way to re-formulate the square root <em>relation</em> as a
<em>function</em> would be to view it as returning a single <em>set</em> of values
as a result: a set containing all of the square roots of a given
argument.  The pair <img class="math" src="_images/math/2e0e4c11bbc8d7da988b640b0dcf2a3fbc1a3242.png" alt="(4, \{2, -2\})"/> is in this relation, for
example, and the relation is also a function in that there is only one
such pair with any given first element.</p>
<p>So far we have dealt with the situation where a relation holds more
than one result for a given argument. The other difficult situation
occurs when there is no result or a given argument, i.e., when the
function or relation is undefined for some argument values. What
should a program return then?</p>
<p>Once again, there’s no good answer. Rather, we generally tweak the
specification to require the implementation of a slightly different
relation. One approach would be to narrow the domain of values that
the <em>program</em> can take to the domain on which the actual mathematical
function is defined. So instead of specifying a square root function
as taking any real number, we could speficy that it requires that an
argument value be non-negative. When we add such a precondition to a
method or function specification in Dafny, the effect is that Dafny
checks every place in the code where the method or function is called
to verify that the argument values satisfy that pre-condition.</p>
<p>Alternately, we might “tweak” the type of the return value, so that
the program can return some value of the promised type, even if the
underlying mathematical function is not defined for the arguments. So,
for example, if instead of promising to return a single number as a
square root we promise to return a set of numbers, then in cases where
the function is undefined, we just return the empty set of numbers.
In this case, the empty set as a return value can be interpreted as
signifying that no numerical answer could be returned.</p>
<p>Finally, in languages such as Java and Python, when a program
encounters a state where a valid value cannot be computed and
returned, it can invoke an error handling routine to take some kind of
“exceptional” action. This is the purpose of exceptions in Java,
Python, etc. We will not entertain the use of exceptions in this
course.</p>

<div class="section" id="imperative-implementation">
<h2>Imperative Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#imperative-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having written a formal specification of the required <em>input-output</em>
behavior of a program, we next write imperative code in a manner, and
in a language, that supports the use of formal logic to <em>reason</em> about
whether the program refines (implements) its formal specification. One
can use formal specifications when programming in any language, but it
helps greatly if the language has strong, static type checking. It is
even better if the language supports formal specification and logical
reasoning mechanisms right alongside of its imperative and functional
programming capabilities. Dafny is such a language and system. It is
not just a language, but a verifier.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing a language with features that help to support
formal reasoning, we sometimes also aim to write imperative code in a
way that makes it easier to reason about formally. As we’ll see below,
for example, the way that we write our while loops can make it easier
or harder to reason about their correctness. Even whether we iterate
from zero up to <em>n</em> or from <em>n</em> down to zero can affect the difficulty
of writing specification elements for a program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formal-verification">
<h2>Formal Verification<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The aim of formal verification is to deduce (to use deductive logic to
<em>prove</em>) that, as written, a program satisfies its specification.  In
more detail, if we’re given a program, <em>C</em> with a precondition, <em>P</em>,
and a postcondition <em>Q</em>, we want a proof that verifies that if <em>C</em> is
started in a state that satisfies <em>P</em> and if it terminates (doesn’t go
into an infinite loop), that it ends in a state that satisfies <em>Q</em>. We
call this property <em>partial correctness</em>.</p>
<p>We write the proposition that <em>C</em> is partially correct (that if it’s
started in a state that satisfies the assertion, <em>P</em>, and that if it
terminates, then it will do so in a state that satisfies assertion
<em>Q</em>) as <img class="math" src="_images/math/b063dc477da14b0ac5629361a924239a6d21680f.png" alt="P \{ C \} Q."/> This is a so-called <em>Hoare triple</em>, named
after the famous computer scientist, Sir Anthony (Tony) Hoare. It is
nothing other than a proposition that claims that <em>C</em> satisfies its
<em>pre-condition/post-condition</em> specification. Another way to read it
is as saying that the combination of the pre-condition being satisfied
and the the program being run implies that the post-condition will be
satisfied.</p>
<p>In addition to a proof of partial correctness, we usually do want to
know that a program also does always terminate. When we have a proof
of both <img class="math" src="_images/math/9ac7caaeb39aaac009f4b0ce25410310e640f332.png" alt="P \{ C \} Q"/> and that the program always terminates,
then we have a proof of <em>total correctness</em>. Dafny is a programming
system that allows us to specify <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> and it then formally, and
to a considerable extent automatically, verifies both <cite>P { C } Q</cite>
and termination.  That is, Dafny produces proofs of total correctness.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that a proof that a program refines
(implements) its formal specification does not necessarily mean that
it is fit for its intended purpose! If the specification is wrong,
then all bets are off, even if the program is correct relative to its
specification.  The problem of <em>validating</em> specification againts
real-world needs is separate from that of <em>verifying</em> that a given
program implements its specification correctly. Formal methods can
help here, as well, by verifying that <em>specifications</em> have certain
desired properties, but formal validation of specifications is not
our main concern at the moment.</p>

<h3>A Buggy Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#a-buggy-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To start, let’s consider an ordinary imperative program, as you might
have written in Python or Java, for computing values of the factorial
function. The name of the function is the only indication here of the
intended behavior of this program. There is no clear specification.</p>
<p>The program takes an argument of type nat (which guarantees that the
argument has the property of being non-negative). It then returns a
nat which the programmer implicitly claims (given the function name)
is the factorial of the argument.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    var t: nat := n;
    var a: nat := 1;
    while (t !=  0)
    {
        a := a * n;
        t := t - 1;
    }
    f := a;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s not immediately obvious whether this code is correct or not,
relative to what we know it’s meant to do. Sadly, this program also
contains a bug. Try to find it. Reason about the behavior of the
program when the argument is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  Does it always compute
the right result? Where is the bug? What is wrong? And how could this
logical error have been detected automatically?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specifications-establish-correctness-criteria">
<h3>Specifications Establish Correctness Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#specifications-establish-correctness-criteria" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A key problem is that the program lacks a precise specification. The
program does <em>something</em>, taking a nat and possibly returning a <em>nat</em>
(unless it goes into an infinite loop) but there’s no way to analyze
its correctness in the absence of a specification that defines what it
even means to be correct.</p>
<p>Now let’s see what happens when we add a formal specification.  Look
at the following code block. That <em>n &gt;= 0</em> continues to be expressed
by the <em>type</em> of the argument, <em>n</em>, being <em>nat</em>. However, we have now
added a postcondition that <em>ensures</em> that the return result will be
the factorial of <em>n</em> as defined by our functional program!  What we
assert is that the result produced by our imperative code is the same
result that <em>would have been produced</em> if we had run the functional
program.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
    ensures f == fact(n)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    var t := n;
    var a := 1;
    while (t !=  0)
    {
        a := a * n;
        t := t - 1;
    }
    return a;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With a specification in place, Dafny now reports that it cannot
guarantee—formally prove to itself—that the <em>postcondition</em> is
guaranteed to hold. Generating proofs is hard, not only for people but
also for machines. In fact, one of seminal results of 20th century
mathematical logic was to prove that there is no general-purpose
algorithm for proving propositions in mathematical logic. That’s good
news for mathematicians!  If this weren’t true, we wouldn’t need them!</p>
<p>So, the best that a machine can do is to try to find a proof for any
given proposition. Sometimes proofs are easy to generate. For example,
it’s easy to prove <em>1 = 1</em> by the <em>reflexive</em> propery of equality.
Other propositions can be hard to prove. Proving that programs in
imperative languages satisfy declarative specifications can be hard.</p>
<p>When Dafny fails to verify a program (find a proof that it satisfies
its specification), there is one of two reasons. Either the program
really does fail to satisfy its specification; or the program is good
but Dafny does not have enough information to know how to prove it.</p>
<p>With the preceding program, the postcondition really isn’t satisfied
due to the bug in the program. When Dafny fails to verify, it gives
us a strong reason to double-check our code to be sure we have not
made some kind of mistake in reasoning.</p>
<p>But even if the program were correct, Dafny would still need a little
more than is given here to prove it. In particular, Dafny would need a
litte more information about how the while loop behaves. It turns out
that providing such extra information about while loops is where much
of the difficulty lies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-verified-implementation-of-the-factorial-function">
<h3>A Verified Implementation of the Factorial Function<a class="headerlink" href="#a-verified-implementation-of-the-factorial-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here, then, is a verified imperative program for computing
factorial. We start by documenting the overall program specification.
The key element here is the ensures clause. This clause links our
imperative program with our functional specification and tells Dafny
to make sure that the reuqired relationship holds.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method verified_factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
    ensures f == fact(n)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now for the body of the method. First, if we’re looking at the case
where <em>n==0</em> we just return the right answer immediately. There is
no need for any further computation.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (n == 0)
{
    return 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The rest of the code handles the case where <em>n &gt; 1</em>. At this point in
the program execution, we believe that <em>n</em> must be greater than zero.
We would have just returned if it were zero, and it can’t be negative
because its type is <em>nat</em>. We can nevertheless formally assert (write
a proposition about the state of the program) that <em>n</em> is greater than
zero. Dafny will try to (and here will successfully) verify that the
assertion is true at this point in the program, no matter what path
through conditionals, while loops, commands led to this point in the
program.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert n &gt; 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To compute an answer for the non-zero input case, we will use a loop.
We can do this by using a variable, a, to hold a “partial factorial
value” in the form of a product of the numbers from n down to a loop
index, “i,” that we start at n and decrement, terminating the loop
when <em>n==0</em>.</p>
<p>At each point just before, during, and right after the loop, <em>a</em> is a
product of the numbers from <em>n</em> down to but not including <em>i</em>, and the
value of <em>i</em> represents how much product-computing work remains to be
done. So, for example, if we’re computing factorial(10) and a holds
the value <em>10 * 9</em>, then <em>i</em> must be <em>8</em> because multiplying <em>a</em> by
the factors from <em>8</em> to <em>1</em> remains to be done.</p>
<p>A critical “invariant” then is that if you multiply <em>a</em> by the
factorial of <em>i</em> you get the the factorial of <em>n</em>.  When we say that
this is an invariant, we mean that it holds before and also after any
execution of the loop body, but not necessarily within the loop
body. In particular, when <em>i</em> gets down to <em>0</em>, this relation means
that <em>a</em> must contain the final result, because <em>a * fact(0)</em> will
then equal <em>fact(n)</em> and <em>fact(0)</em> is just <em>1</em>, so <em>a</em> must equal
<em>fact(n)</em>.</p>
<p>This is how we design loops so that we can be confident that they do
what we want tem to do. So now let’s go through the steps required to
implement our looping strategy.</p>
<p>Step 1. Set up state for the loop to work. We first initializie a := 1
and i := n.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var i: nat := n;    // nat type of i explicit
var a := 1;         // can let Dafny infer it
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It would now be a good idea to ask Dafny to check that the invariant
holds. See the next bit of code, below. Note that we are again using
our pure functional definition, <em>fact</em>, as a <em>specification</em> of the
function we’re implementing.</p>
<p>In Dafny, we can use matnematical logic to express what must be true
at any given point in the execution of a program in the form of an
“assertion.” Here we assert that our loop invariant holds. The Dafny
verifier tries to prove that the assertion is a true propsition about
the state of the program when control reaches this point, no matter
what path might have been taken to arrive at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a * fact(i) == fact(n); // &quot;invariant&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Step 2: Now we write the actual loop command. Recall how a <em>while</em>
loop works. To evaluate a loop, one evaluates the loop condition. If
the result is false, the loop body does not execute and the loop
terminates.  Otherwise, the loop body is executed once and then the
whole loop is run again (starting with a new evaluation of the loop
condition).</p>
<p>We want our loop body to run at least once, as we already handled the
case where it doesn’t need to run at all. It will run if i &gt; 0. What
is i? We initialized it to n and haven’t change it since then so it
must still be equal to n. Do we know that n is greater than 0? We do,
because (1) it can’t be negative owning to its type, and (2) it can’t
be 0 because if it were 0 the program would already have returned.</p>
<p>We can now do better than just reasoning in our heads. We can also use
logic to express what we believe to be true and let Dafny try to check
it for us automatically.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i &gt; 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now if <em>i</em> is one, then the loop body will run once. The value of <em>a</em>,
which starts at 1, will be multiplied by i, which is 1, then i will be
decremented, taking the the value 0. The loop will be run again, but
the loop condition will be found to be false, and to the loop body
will not be executed and the loop will terminate. When it does, it
will leave <em>a</em> with the value 1, which is the right answer.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>while (i &gt;  0)
    invariant 0 &lt;= i &lt;= n
    invariant fact(n) == a * fact(i)
{
    a := a * i;
    i := i - 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If <em>i</em> is greater than 1, the loop body will execute, multiplying <em>a</em>
by the current value of <em>i</em> and <em>i</em> will be decremented. The vaue of
<em>a</em> will be the partial value of the factorial computed so far, and
the value of <em>i</em> will represent the work that remains to be done. When
<em>i</em> reaches zero, all the work will be done, and <em>a</em> will contain the
final result.</p>
<p>However, Dafny cannot determine on its own that this will be the case.
What it needs to know to reason “mechanically” about the program is a
bit of additional information about what remains true no matter <em>how</em>
many times the loop body executes (zero or more). That information is
expressed in the loop <em>invariants</em>. The first one is true but not of
much use. The second one is the key to enabling Dafny to verify that
after the loop, <em>a == fact(n)</em>.</p>
<p>The invariant itself just says that at all points before and after the
loop body executes, that partial factorial value computed so far times
the factorial of <em>i</em> (which remains to be computed) is the answer that
we seek. Once the loop is done we (and Dafny) <em>also</em> know that <em>i == 0</em>.
It is the combination of the invariant and this fact that enables Dafny
to see that it must be the case that <em>a == fact(n)</em>.</p>
<p>We can verify by using asserts after the loop that our beliefs about
what the state of the program must be are correct. First, let’s have
Dafny check that the loop condition is now false.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert !(i &gt; 0);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can also have Dafny check that our loop invariant still holds.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a * fact(i) == fact(n);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now comes the most crucial step of all in our reasoning. We can
deduce that <em>a</em> now holds the correct answer. That this is so follows
from the conjunction of the two assertions we just made. First, that
<em>i</em> is not greater than <em>0</em> and given that its type is <em>nat</em>, the only
possible value it can have now is <em>0</em>. That’s what we’d expect, as it
is the condition on which the loop terminates (which it just did). But
better than just saying all of this, let us also formalize, document,
and check it using the Dafny verifier.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i == 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now it’s easy to see. No matter what value <em>i</em> has, we know that the
loop invariant holds: <img class="math" src="_images/math/ad82ca55b2161087ebbfa94fcea97fb5a09997cb.png" alt="a * fact(i) == fact(n),"/> and we also know
that <em>i == 0</em>. So it must be that <img class="math" src="_images/math/3c66b73cf306943edbe6de7b4d4f81b086bc6af3.png" alt="a * fact(0) == fact(n)."/> And
fact(0) is <em>1</em> (from its mathematical definition). So it must be that
<em>a == fact(n)</em>. And Dafny confirms it!</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a == fact(n);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We thus have the answer we need to return.  Dafny verifies that our
program satisfies its formal specification. We no longer have to
pray. We <em>know</em> that our program is right and Dafny confirms our
belief.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>return a;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Mathematical logic is to software as the calculus is to physics and
engineering.  It’s not just an academic curiosity. It is a critical
intellectual tool, inceasingly used for precise specification and
semi-automated reasoning about and verification of real programs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case-study-the-fibonacci-function">
<h2>Case Study: The Fibonacci Function<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-the-fibonacci-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similarly, here is a verified imperative implementation of the
Fibonacci function. We start by adding a specification in the
form of an ensures clause, appealing to our functional program,
to tell Dafny what the imperative program must compute.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method fibonacci(n: nat) returns (r: nat)
    ensures r == fib(n)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now for the body. First we represent values for the two cases where
the result requires no further computation.  Initially, <em>fib0</em> will
store the value of <em>fib(0)</em>, namely <em>0</em>, and <em>fib1</em> will store the
value of <em>fib(1)</em>, namely <em>1</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var fib0, fib1 := 0, 1; //parallel assignment
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, we test to see if either of these cases applies,
and if so we just return the appropriate result.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (n == 0) { return fib0; }
if (n == 1) { return fib1; }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, we know something more about the state of the program
than was the case when we started. We can deduce that <em>n</em> has to be
greater than or equal to <em>2</em>. This is because it initially had to be
greater than or equal to zero due to its type, and we would already
have returned if it were <em>0</em> or <em>1</em>. It must now be <em>2</em> or greater. We
can assert this proposition about the state of the program at this
point, and Dafny will verify it for us.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert n &gt;= 2;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now we have to deal with the case where <em>n &gt;= 2</em>. Our strategy for
computing <em>fib(n)</em> in this case is, again, to use a while loop. We
will establish a loop index <em>i</em>.  Our design will be based on the idea
that at the beginning and end of each loop iteration (we are currently
at the beginning), we will have already computed <em>fib(i)</em> and that its
value is in <em>fib1</em>. We’ve already assigned the value of <em>fib(0)</em> to
<em>fib0</em>, and <em>fib(1)</em> to <em>fib1</em>, so to set up the desired state, we
initialize <em>i</em> to be <em>1</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var i := 1;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can now assert and Dafny can verify a number of conditions that we
expect and require to hold. First, <em>fib1</em> equals <em>fib(i)</em>. To compute
the next (<em>i+1st</em>) Fibonacci number, we need not only the value of
<em>fib(i)</em> but also <em>fib(i-1)</em>. We will thus also want <em>fib0</em> to hold
this value at the start and end of each loop iteration. Indeed we do
have this state of affairs right now.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert fib1 == fib(i);
assert fib0 == fib(i-1);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To compute <em>fib(n)</em> for any <em>n</em> greater than or equal to <em>2</em> will
require at least one execution of the loop body. We’ll thus set our
loop condition to be <em>i &lt; n</em>. This ensures that the loop body will run
at least once, to compute <em>fib(2)</em>, as <em>i</em> is <em>1</em> and <em>n</em> is at least
<em>2</em>; so the loop condition <em>i &lt; n</em> is <em>true</em>, which dictates that the
loop body must be evaluated at least once.</p>
<p>Within the loop body we’ll compute <em>fib(i+1)</em> (we call it <em>fib2</em>) by
adding together <em>fib0</em> and <em>fib1</em>; then we increment <em>i</em>; then we
update <em>fib0</em> and <em>fib1</em> so that for the <em>new</em> value of <em>i</em> they hold
<em>fib(i-1)</em> and <em>fib(i)</em>. To do this we assign the initial value of
<em>fib1</em> to <em>fib0</em> and the value of <em>fib2</em> to <em>fib1</em>. Think hard so as
to confirm for yourself that this sequence of actions re-establishes
the loop invariant.</p>
<p>Let’s work an example. Suppose <em>n</em> happens to be <em>2</em>. The loop body
will run, and after the one execution, <em>i</em> will have the value, <em>2</em>;
<em>fib1</em> will have the value of <em>fib(2)</em>, and <em>fib0</em> will have the value
of <em>fib(1)</em>. Because <em>i</em> is now <em>2</em> and <em>n</em> is <em>2</em>, the loop condition
will now be false and the loop will terminate. The value of <em>fib1</em>
will of course be <em>fib(i)</em> but now we also have the negation of the
loop condition, i.e., <em>i == n</em>. So <em>fib(i)</em> will be <em>fib(n)</em>, which is
the result we want and that we return.</p>
<p>We can also informally prove to ourself that this strategy gives us a
program that always terminates and returns a value. That is, it does
not go into an infinite loop. To see this, note that the value of <em>i</em>
is initally less than or equal to <em>n</em>, and it increases by only <em>1</em> on
each time through the loop. The value of <em>n</em> is finite, so the value
of <em>i</em> will eventually equal the value of <em>n</em> at which point the loop
condition will be falsified and the looping will end.</p>
<p>What Dafny looks for to verify that a given loop terminates is a value
that <em>decreases</em> each time the loop runs and that is bounded below so
that it cannot decrease forever. As <em>i</em> increases in this loop, it can
not be the decreasing quantity. What Dafny takes instead is <em>n - i</em>.
When <em>i</em> is <em>0</em> this value is large, and as <em>i</em> gets closer to <em>n</em> it
decreases until when <em>i == n</em>, the difference is zero, and that is the
bound at which the loop terminates.</p>
<p>That’s our strategy. Here’s the while loop that we have designed. Now
for the first time, we see something crucial. In general, Dafny has no
idea how many times a loop body will execute. Intead, what it needs to
know are properties of the state of the program that hold no matter
how many times the loop executes, that, when combined with the fact
that the has terminated allows one to conclude that the loop does what
it’s meant to do. We call such properties <em>loop invariants</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>while (i &lt; n)
    invariant i &lt;= n;
    invariant fib0 == fib(i-1);
    invariant fib1 == fib(i);
{
    var fib2 := fib0 + fib1;
    fib0 := fib1;
    fib1 := fib2;
    i := i + 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The invariants are just the conditions that we required to hold for
our design of the loop to work. First, <em>i</em> must never exceed <em>n</em>. If
it did, the loop would spin off into infinity. Second, to compute the
next (the <em>i+1st)</em> Fibonacci number we have to have the previous <em>two</em>
in memory. So <em>fib0</em> better hold <em>fib(i-1)</em> and <em>fib1</em>, <em>fib(i)</em>. Note
that these conditions do not have to hold at all times <em>within</em> the
execution of the loop body, where things are being updated, but they
do have to hold before before and after each execution.</p>
<p>The body of the loop is just as we described it above. We can use our
minds to deduce that if the invariants hold before each loop body runs
(and they do), then they will also hold after it runs. We can also see
that after the loop terminates, it must be that <em>i==n</em>, because we
know that it’s always true that <em>i &lt;= n</em> and the loop condition must
now be false, which is to say that <em>i</em> can no longer be strictly less
than <em>n</em>, so <em>i</em> must now equal <em>n</em>. Logic says so.</p>
<p>What is amazing is that we can write these assertions in Dafny if we
wish to, and Dafny will verify that they are true statements about the
state of the program after the loop has run. We have <em>proved</em> (or
rather Dafny has proved) that our loop always terminates with the
right answer. We have a formal proof of <em>total correctness</em> for this
program.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i &lt;= n;      // invariant
assert !(i &lt; n);    // loop condition is false
assert (i &lt;= n) &amp;&amp; !(i &lt; n) ==&gt; (i == n);
assert i == n;      // deductive conclusion
assert fib1 == fib(i); // invariant
assert fib1 == fib(i) &amp;&amp; (i==n) ==&gt; fib1 == fib(n);
assert fib1 == fib(n);
return fib1;

<h2>What is Dafny, Again?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-dafny-again" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dafny is a cutting-edge software language and toolset for verification
of imperative code. It was developed at Microsoft Research—one of
the top computer science research labs in the world. We are exploring
Dafny and the ideas underlying it in the first part of this course to
give a sense of why it’s vital for a computer scientist today to have
a substantial understanding of logic and proofs along with the ability
to <em>code</em>.</p>
<p>Tools such as TLA+, Dafny, and others of this variety give us a way
both to express formal specifications and imperative code in a unified
way (albeit in different sub-languages), and to have some automated
checking done in an attempt to verify that code satisfies its spec.</p>
<p>We say <em>attempt</em> here, because in general verifying the consistency of
code and a specification is a literally unsolvable problem. In cases
that arise in practice, much can often be done. It’s not always easy,
but if one requires ultra-high assurance of the consistency of code
and specification, then there is no choice but to employ the kinds of
<em>formal methods</em> introduced here.</p>
<p>To understand how to use such state-of-the-art software development
tools and methods, one must understand not only the language of code,
but also the languages of mathematical logic, including set and type
theory. One must also understand precisely what it means to <em>prove</em>
that a program satisfies its specification. And for that, one must
develop a sense for propositions and proofs: what they are and how
they are built and evaluated.</p>
<p>The well educated computer scientist and the professional software
engineer must understand logic and proofs as well as coding, and how
they work together to help build <em>trustworthy</em> systems. Herein lies
the deep relevance of logic and proofs, which might otherwise seem
like little more than abstract nonsense and a distraction from the
task of learning how to program.</p>
