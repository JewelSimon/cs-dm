<h1>7. Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Modern mathematics is largely founded on set theory: in particular, on
what is called <em>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of Choice</em>,
or <em>ZFC</em>. Every concept you have ever learned in mathematics can, in
principle, be reduced to expresions involving sets.  For example,
every natural number can be represented as a set: zero as the <em>empty
set, {}</em>; one as the set containing the empty set, <em>{{}}</em>; two as the
set that contains that set, <em>{{{}}}</em>; ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Set theory includes the treatment of sets, including the special cases
of relations (sets of tuples), functions (<em>single-valued</em> relations),
sequences (functions from natural numbers to elements), and other such
concepts.  ZFC is a widely accepted <em>formal foundation</em> for modern
mathematics: a set of axioms that describe properties of sets, from
which all the rest of mathematics can be deduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="naive-set-theory">
<h2>Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So what is a set? A <em>naive</em> definition (which will actually be good
enough for our purposes and for most of practical computer science) is
that a set is just an unordered collection of elements. In principle,
these elements are themselves reducible to sets but we don’t need to
think in such reductionist terms. We can think about a set of natural
numbers, for example, without having to think of each number as itself
being some weird kind of set.</p>
<p>In practice, we just think sets as unordered collections of elements
of some kind, where any given element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> any
given set. An object can be a member of many different sets, but can
only by in any give set zero or one times. Membership is binary.  So,
for example, when we combine (take the <em>union</em> of) two sets, each of
which contains some common element, the resulting combined set will
have that element as a member, but it won’t have it twice.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces <em>naive</em>, which is to say <em>intuitive and
practical</em>, set theory. It does not cover <em>axiomatic</em> set theory, in
which every concept is ultimately reduced to a set of logical axioms
that define what precisely it means to be a set and what operations
can be use to manipulate sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overly-naive-set-theory">
<h2>Overly Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#overly-naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we go on, however, we review a bit of history to understand
that an overly naive view of sets can lead to logical contradictions
that make such a theory useless as a foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the founders of modern logic, Gotlob Frege, had as his central
aim to establish logical foundations for all of mathematics: to show
that everything could be reduced to a set of axioms, or propositions
accepted without question, from which all other mathematical truths
could be deduced.  The concept of a set was central to his effort. His
logic therefore allowed one to define sets as collections of elements
that satisfy given propositions, and to talk about whether any given
element is in a particular set of not. Frege’s notion of sets, in
turn, traced back to the work of Georg Cantor.</p>
<p>But then, boom! In 1903, the British analytical philosopher, Bertrand
Russell, published a paper presenting a terrible paradox in Frege’s
conception. Russell showed that a logic involving naive set theory
would be <em>inconsistent</em> (self-contradicting) and there useless as a
foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>To see the problem, one consider the set, <em>S</em>, of all sets that do not
contain themselves. In <em>set comprehension</em> notation, we would write
this set as <img class="math" src="_images/math/5fd8e13bfdfe8ceff488029c124be7e2e32abe0b.png" alt="S = \{ a: set | a \notin a \}."/> That is, <em>S</em> is the
set of elements, <em>a</em>, each a set, such that <em>a</em> is not a member of
itself.</p>
<p>Now ask the decisive question: Does <em>S</em> contain itself?</p>
<p>Let’s adopt a notation, <em>C(S)</em>, to represent the proposition that <em>S</em>
contains itself. Now suppose that <em>C(S)</em> is true, i.e., that <em>S</em> does
contain itself. In this case, <em>S</em>, being a set that contains itself,
cannot be a member of <em>S</em>, because we just defined <em>S</em> to be the set
of sets that do <em>not</em> contain themselves. So, the assumption that <em>S</em>
contains itself leads to the conclusion that <em>S</em> does not contain
itself. In logical terms, <img class="math" src="_images/math/88fed86576b69c7f57881ccfe1f506808ec16b07.png" alt="C(S) \rightarrow \neg C(S)."/> This is
a contradiction and thus a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Now suppose <em>S</em> does not contain itself: <img class="math" src="_images/math/4a4e43a13b62324114a4b955a446319f03c21fac.png" alt="\neg C(S)."/>. Being
such a set, and given that <em>S</em> is the set of sets that do not contain
themselves, it must now be in <em>S</em>. So <img class="math" src="_images/math/2bf28ffcfdbea32d11c7145b71a2883546e258a6.png" alt="\neg C(S) \rightarrow
C(S)."/> The assumption that it does <em>not</em> contain itself leads right
back to the conclusion that it <em>does</em> contain itself. Either the set
does or does not contain itself, but assuming either case leads to a
contradictory conclusion. All is lost!</p>
<p>That such an internal self-contradiction can arise in such a simple
way (or at all) is a complete disaster for any logic. The whole point
of a logic is that it gives one a way to reason that is sound, which
means that from true premises one can never reach a contradictory
conclusion. If something that is impossible can be proved to be true
in a given theory, then anything at all can be proved to be true, and
the whole notion of truth just collapses into meaninglessness. As soon
as Frege saw Russell’s Paradox, he knew that that was <em>game over</em> for
his profound attempt to base mathematics on a logic grounded in his
(Cantor’s) naive notion of sets.</p>
<p>Two solutions were eventually devised. Russell introduced a notion of
<em>types</em>, as opposed to sets, per se, as a foundation for mathematics.
The basic idea is that one can have elements of a certain <em>type</em>; then
sets of elements of that type, forming a new type; then sets of sets
elements of that type, forming yet another type; but one cannot even
talk about a set containing (or not containing) itself, because sets
can only contain elements of types lower in the type hierarchy.</p>
<p>The concept of types developed by Russell lead indirectly to modern
type theory, which remains an area of very active exploration in both
computer science and pure mathematics. Type theory is being explored
as an alternative foundation for mathematics, and is at the very heart
of a great deal of work going on in the areas of programming language
design and formal software specification and verification.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zermelo repaired the paradox by adjusting some of
the axioms of set theory, to arrive at the starting point of what has
become ZFC. When we work in set theory today, whether with a <em>naive</em>
perspective or not, we are usually working in a set theory the logical
basic of which is ZFC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sets">
<h2>Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For our purposes, the <em>naive</em> notion of sets will be good enough. We
will take a <em>set</em> to be an unordered finite or infinite collection of
<em>elements</em>. An element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> a set, and can be in
a set at most once.  In this chapter, we will not encounter any of the
bizarre issues that Russell and others had to consider at the start of
the 20th century.</p>
<p>What we will find is that set-theoretical thinking is an incredibly
powerful intellectual tool. It’s at the heart of program specification
and verification, algorithm design and analysis, and theory of
computing, among many other areas in computer science. Moreover, Dafny
makes set theory not only fun but executable. The logic of Dafny, for
writing assertions, pre- and post-conditions, and invariants <em>is</em> set
theory, a first-order logic with sets and set-related operations as
built-in concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-theory-notations">
<h2>Set Theory Notations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory-notations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="display-notation">
<h3>Display notation<a class="headerlink" href="#display-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In everyday mathematical writing, and in Dafny, we denote small sets by
listing the elements of the set within curly brace. If <em>S</em> is the set
containing the numbers, one, two, and three, for example, we can write
<em>S</em> as <img class="math" src="_images/math/681866a8f518adc2b652c8a583e1b642e424b55b.png" alt="\{ 1, 2, 3 \}."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, we would write almost the same thing.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S:set&lt;int&gt; := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code introduces the variable, <em>S</em>, declares that its type is
<em>finite set of integer</em> (<em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em> being the type of <em>infinite</em> sets
of elements of tyep <em>T</em>), and assigns to <em>S</em> the set value, <img class="math" src="_images/math/b7d2529464caa57ee93b6344aa404e3030bb115a.png" alt="\{
1, 2, 3 \}."/> Because the value on the right side of the assignment
operator, is evidently a set of integers, Dafny will infer the type of
<em>S</em>, and the explicit type declaration can therefore be omitted.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When a set is finite but too large to write down easily as a list of
elements, but when it has a regular structure, mathematicians often
denote such a set using an elipsis. For example, a set, <em>S</em>, of even
natural numbers from zero to one hundred could be written like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/9a00b3fe8646fb985d914bf4e01ecb01aec599d2.png" alt="S = \{ 0, 2, 4, \ldots, 100 \}."/> This expression is a kind of
quasi-formal mathematics. It’s mostly formal but leaves details that
an educated person should be able to infer to the human reader.</p>
<p>It is not (currently) possible to write such expressions in Dafny.
Dafny does not try to fill in missing details in specifications. A
system that does do such a thing might make a good research project.
On the other hand, ordinary mathematical writing as well as Dafny do
have ways to precisely specify sets, including even infinite sets, in
very concise ways, using what is called <em>set comprehension</em> or <em>set
builder</em> notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-comprehension-notation">
<h3>Set comprehension notation<a class="headerlink" href="#set-comprehension-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Take the example of the set, <em>S</em>, of even numbers from zero to one
hundred, inclusive. We can denote this set precisely in mathematical
writing as <img class="math" src="_images/math/87faf1ea63943abec666b096763f6edc923017c0.png" alt="S = \{ n: {\mathbb Z}~|~0 &lt;= n &lt;= 100 \land n~mod~2
= 0 \}."/> Let’s pull this expression apart.</p>
<p>The set expression (to the right of the first equals sign) can be read
in three parts. The vertical bar is read <em>such that</em>. To the left of
the bar is an expression identifying the set from which the elements
of <em>this</em> set are drawn, and a name is given to an arbitrary element
of this source set. So here we can say that <em>S</em> is a set each element
<em>n</em> of which is a natural number.  A name, here <em>n</em>, for an arbitrary
element is given for two purposes. First it desribes the form of
elements in the set being built: here just <em>integers</em>. Second, the
name can then be used in writing a condition that must be true of each
such element.  That expression is written to the right of the vertical
bar.</p>
<p>Here the condition is that each such element, <em>n</em> must be greater than
or equal to zero, less than or equal to one hundred, and even, in that
the remainder must be zero when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>2</em>. The overall set
comprehension expression is thus read literally as, <em>S</em> is the set of
integers, <em>n</em>, such that <em>n</em> is greater than or equal to zero, <em>n</em> is
less than or equal to 100, and <em>n</em> evenly divisible by <em>2</em>. A more
fluent reading would simply be <em>S</em> is the set of even integers between
zero and one hundred inclusive.</p>
<p>Dafny supports set comprehension notations. This same set would be
written as follows (we assume that the type of S has already been
declared to be <em>set&lt;int&gt;)</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 100;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another way to define the same set in ordinary mathematical writing
would use a slightly richer form of set comprehension notation. In
particular, we can define the same set as the set of values of the
expression <em>2*n</em> for <em>n</em> is in the range zero to fifty, inclusive.
Where it’s readily inferred, mathematicians will usually also leave
out explicit type information. <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>S = { 2 * n | 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 }. In
this expression it’s inferred that <em>n</em> ranges over all the natural
numbers, these values are <em>filtered</em> by the expression on the right,
and these filtered values are then fed through the expression on the
left of the bar to produce the elements of the intended set.</p>
<p>Dafny also supports set comprehension notation in this style. To
define this very same set in Dafny we could also write this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50 :: 2 * s;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command assigns to S a set of values, <em>2 * s</em>,, where <em>s</em>
ranges over the integers and satisfies the predicate (or filter)
<em>0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50</em>.</p>
<p>The collection of values from which element are drawn to be
build into a new set need not just be a built-in type but can
be another programmer-defined set. Given that <em>S</em> is the set
of even numbers from zero to one hundred, we can define the
subset of <em>S</em> of elements that are less than <em>25</em> by writing
a richer set comprehension. In pure mathematical writing, we
could write <img class="math" src="_images/math/9cc14614aedd949a467fd052edd0f4f2e3862dd0.png" alt="T = \{ t | t \in S \land t &lt; 25\}."/> That is,
<em>T</em> is the set of elements that are in <em>S</em> and less than <em>25</em>.
The Dafny notation is a little different, but not too much:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var T := set t | t in S &amp;&amp; t &lt; 25;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This Dafny code defines <em>T</em> to be the set (of integers, but note that
we let Dafny infer the type of <em>t</em> in this case), such that <em>t</em> is in
the set <em>S</em> (that we just defined) and <em>t</em> is also less than <em>25</em>.</p>
<p>As a final example, let’s suppose that we want to define the set of
all ordered pairs whose first elements are from <em>S</em> and whose second
elements are from <em>T</em>, as we’ve defined them here. For example, the
pair <em>(76,24)</em> would be in this set, but not <em>(24 76)</em>. In ordinary
mathematical writing, this would be <img class="math" src="_images/math/6e93c4191ebb0fdc2a5106f5991ef00a0665e9f8.png" alt="\{ (s,t) | s \in S \land t
\in T\}."/> This set is, as we’ll learn more about shortly, called the
<em>product set</em> of the sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In Danfy, this would be written like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var Q := set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s, t);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code assigns to the new variable, <em>Q</em>, a set formed by taking
elements, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>,, such that <em>s</em> is in <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is in <em>T</em>, and
forming the elements of the new set as tuples, <em>(s, t)</em>. This is a far
easier way to write code for a product set than by explicit iteration
over the sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>!</p>
<p>In Dafny, the way to extract an element of a tuple, <em>t</em>, of arity,
<em>n</em>, is by writing <em>t.n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a natural number in the range
<em>0</em> up to <em>n - 1</em>. So, for example, <em>(3, 4).1</em> evaluates to <em>4</em>. It’s
not a notation that is common to many programming languages. One can
think of it as a kind of subscripting, but using a different notation
than the usual square bracket subscripting used with sequences.</p>

<h2>Set Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="cardinality">
<h3>Cardinality<a class="headerlink" href="#cardinality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By the cardinality of a set, <em>S</em>, we mean the number of elements
in S. When <em>S</em> is finite, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is a natural number.
The cardinarily of the empty set is zero, for example, because it has
no (zero) elements. In ordinary mathematics, if <em>S</em> is a finite set,
then its cardinality is denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/bca4eb7c95f7b9bb9f0b55ab74fb48501c374794.png" alt="|S|"/>. With <em>S</em> defined as in
the preceding section, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is <em>50</em>. (There are
<em>50</em> numbers between <em>0</em> and <em>49</em>, inclusive.)</p>
<p>The Dafny notation for set cardinality is just the same. The following
code will print the cardinality of <em>S</em>, namely <em>50</em>, for example.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print |S|;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a set is infinite in size, as for example is the set of natural
numbers, the cardinality of the set is obviously not any natural
number. One has entered the realm of <em>transfinite numbers</em>. We will
discuss transfinite numbers later in this course. In Dafny, as you
might expect, the cardinality operator is not defined for infinite
sets (of type <em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equality">
<h3>Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two sets are considered equal if and only if they contain exactly
the same elements. To assert that sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are equal in
mathematical writing, we would write <em>S = T</em>. In Dafny, such an
assertion would be written, <em>S == T</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subset">
<h3>Subset<a class="headerlink" href="#subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A set, <em>T</em>, can be said to be a subset of a set <em>S</em> if and only if
every element in <em>T</em> is also in <em>S</em>. In this case, mathematicians
write <img class="math" src="_images/math/006926e4a2b3b3a55129b93b7ab1fedf68da96eb.png" alt="T \subseteq S"/>. In mathematical logic notation, we would
write, <img class="math" src="_images/math/0e4eb07fe9d633c95c2e21bf6f6f70df946e43f6.png" alt="T \subseteq S \iff \forall t \in T, t \in S"/>. That is,
<em>T</em> is a subset of <em>S</em> if and only if every element in <em>T</em> is also in
<em>S</em>.</p>
<p>A set <em>T</em>, is said to be a <em>proper</em> subset of <em>S</em>, if <em>T</em> is a subset
of <em>S</em> but <em>T</em> is not equal to <em>S</em>. In our example, <em>T</em> (the set of
even natural numbers less than <em>25</em>) is a proper subset of <em>S</em> (the
set of even natural numbers less than or equal to <em>100</em>).</p>
<p>This is written in mathematics as <img class="math" src="_images/math/5e1985f6ce3ef221173377903e0f65930b9412aa.png" alt="T \subset S"/>. In other words,
every element of <em>T</em> is in <em>S</em> but there is at least one element of
<em>S</em> that is not in <em>T</em>. Mathematically, <img class="math" src="_images/math/bf151b36ad97d9a191db89e96fefaf66e90ba2b3.png" alt="T \subset S \iff
\forall t \in T, t \in S \land \exists s \in S, s \notin T"/>.</p>
<p>The backwards <em>E</em> is the <em>existential quantifier</em> in first-order
logic, and is read as, and means, <em>there exists.</em> So this expression
says that <em>T</em> is a proper subset of <em>S</em> if every <em>t</em> in <em>T</em> is in <em>S</em>
but there is at least one <em>s</em> in <em>S</em> that is not in <em>T</em>. That the
proper subset operator contains an implicit existential operator poses
some real problems for verification.</p>
<p>Without getting into details, when one asserts in Dafny that <em>T</em> is a
proper subset of <em>S</em>, Dafny needs to find an element of <em>S</em> that is
not in <em>T</em>, and in general, it needs a lot of help to do that. The
details are out of scope at this point, but one should be aware of the
difficulty.</p>
<p>In Dafny, one uses the usual arithmetic less and less than or
equal operator symbols, <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&lt;=</em>, to assert <em>proper subset</em> and
<em>subset</em> relationships, respectively. The first two of the following
assertions are thus both true in Dafny, but the third is not. That
said, limitations in the Dafny verifier make it hard for Dafny to see
the truth of such assertions without help. We will not discuss how to
provide such help at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert T &lt; S;
assert T &lt;= S;
assert S &lt;= T;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We note every set is a subset, but not a proper subset, of
itself. It’s also the case that the empty set is a subset of every
set, in that <em>all</em> elements in the empty set are in any other set,
because there are none. In logic-speak, we’d say <em>a universally
quantified proposition over an empty set is trivially true.</em></p>
<p>If we reverse the operator, we get the notion of supersets and proper
supersets. If <em>T</em> is a subset of <em>S</em>, then <em>S</em> is a superset of <em>T</em>,
written, <img class="math" src="_images/math/545f54f8cb60943285b183ae5bc52fb0fc87ad16.png" alt="S \supseteq T"/>. If <em>T</em> is a proper subset of <em>S</em> then
<em>S</em> is a proper superset of <em>T</em>, written <img class="math" src="_images/math/65e6f407c7dfce0fa7d0f9e6db27595235e657f2.png" alt="S \supset T"/>. In
Dafny, the greater than and greater than or equals operator are used
to denote proper superset and superset relationships between sets.
So, for example, <em>S &gt;= T</em> is the assertion that <em>S</em> is a superset of
<em>T</em>. Note that every set is a superset of itself, but never a proper
superset of itself, and every set is a superset of the empty set.</p>

<h3>Intersection<a class="headerlink" href="#intersection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The intersection, <img class="math" src="_images/math/5391bb4cd9797217ba8e85da016c08f73cf66ba9.png" alt="S \cap T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the
set of elements that are in both <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. Mathematically speaking,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/b93e4637c8680497c56648862807d1a3965cacd8.png" alt="S \cap T = \{ e~|~e \in S \land e \in T \}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, the <em>*</em> operator is used for set intersection.  The
intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is thus written <em>S * T</em>. For example, the
command <em>Q := S * T</em> assigns the intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the
new value of <em>Q</em>.</p>

<h3>Union<a class="headerlink" href="#union" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The union, <img class="math" src="_images/math/10bb12eb90bac33ab070fa2ff9405b721df1230e.png" alt="S \cup T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the set of
elements that are in either (including both) <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. That is,

<p>In Dafny, the <em>+</em> operator is used for set union.  The union of <em>S</em>
and <em>T</em> is thus written <em>S + T</em>. For example, the command <em>V := S +
T</em> assigns the union of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the new value of <em>V</em>.</p>

<h3>Difference<a class="headerlink" href="#difference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difference, <img class="math" src="_images/math/455ad52d8d5f1358ba3b36231f49b853407b6bdd.png" alt="S \setminus T"/> (<em>S</em> minus <em>T</em>), of sets <em>S</em> and
<em>T</em> is the set of elements in <em>S</em> that are not also in <em>T</em>. Thus,

minus sign is used to denote set difference, as in the expression,
<em>S - T</em>. Operators in Dafny can be applied to sets to make up more
complex expressions. So, for example, <em>|S-T|</em> denotes the cardinality
of <em>S-T</em>.</p>

<h3>Product Set<a class="headerlink" href="#product-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The product set, <img class="math" src="_images/math/64a6eff94bb737b50c491df7ab889fd0c11ecb02.png" alt="S \times T"/>, is the set of all the ordered
pairs, <em>(s,t)</em>, that can be formed by taking one element, <em>s</em>, from
<em>S</em>, and one element, <em>t</em>, from <em>T</em>. That is, <img class="math" src="_images/math/66db47fecf99101ab90735c11092ae3be332839a.png" alt="S \times T = \{
(s, t) | s \in S \land t \in T \}"/>. The cardinality of a product set
is the product of the cardinalities of the individual sets.</p>
<p>There is no product set operator, per se, in Dafny, but given sets,
<em>S</em> and <em>T</em> a product set can easily be expressed using Dafny’s set
comprehension notation: <em>set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s,t)</em>. The
keyword, <em>set</em>, is followed by the names of the variables that will be
used to form the set comprehension expression, followed by a colon,
followed by an assertion that selects the values of <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> that
will be included in the result, followed by a double colon, and then,
finally an expression using the local variables that states how each
value of the resulting set will be formed.</p>

<h3>Power Set<a class="headerlink" href="#power-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The power set of a set, <em>S</em>, denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/13c471ff6a4226c1aeff17f10d4693215420d207.png" alt="{\mathbb P}(S),"/> is the
set of all subsets of <em>S</em>. If <em>S = {1, 2 }</em>, for example, the powerset
of <em>S</em> is the set containing the proper and improper subsets of <em>S</em>,
namely <em>{}, { 1 }, { 2 },</em> and <em>{ 1, 2}</em>.</p>
<p>The powerset of a set with <em>n</em> element will have <img class="math" src="_images/math/798d39775b3c54beddeb31ad508597409e6e7c43.png" alt="2^n"/> elements.
Consider the powerset of the empty set. The only subset of the empty
set is the empty set itself, so the powerset of the empty set is the
set containing only the empty set. This set has just <em>1</em> element. It’s
cardinality thus satisfies the rule, as <em>2</em> to the power, zero (the
number of elements in the empty set), is <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that for every set, <em>S</em>, with cardinality <em>n</em>, the
cardinality of its powerset is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>. Consider a set, <em>S’</em>,
of cardinality one bigger than that of <em>S</em>. Its powerset contains
every set in the powerset of <em>S</em>, plus every set in that set with the
new element included, and that’s all the element it includes.</p>
<p>The number of sets in the powerset of <em>S’</em> is thus double the number
of sets in the powerset of <em>S</em>. Given that the cardinality of the
powerset of <em>S</em> is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>, the cardinality of <em>S’</em>, being
twice that number, is <em>2</em> to the <em>n + 1</em>.</p>
<p>Now because the rule holds for sets of size zero, and whenver it holds
for sets of size <em>n</em> it also holds for sets of size <em>n + 1</em>, it must
hold for sets of every (finite) size. So what we have is an informal
<em>proof by induction</em> of a theorem: <img class="math" src="_images/math/6286656ea11925e78858a3878bc9be8a2866eeb9.png" alt="\forall S, |{\mathbb P}(S)|
= 2^{|S|}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, there is no explicit powerset operator, one that would take
a set and returning its powerset, but the concept can be expressed in
an elegant form using a set comprehension. The solution is simply to
say <em>the set of all sets that are subsets of a given set, *</em>. In pure
mathematical notation this would be <img class="math" src="_images/math/e81fbf5e8d1ab6627d0ef257362d2d412eedc562.png" alt="{ R | R \subseteq S }."/> In
Dafny it’s basically the same expression.  The follwing three-line
program computes and prints out the powerset of <em>S = { 1, 2, 3 }</em>.
The key expression is to the right of the assignment operator on the
second line.</p>

<p>Exercise: Write a pure function that when given a value of type set&lt;T&gt;
returns its powerset. The function will have to be polymorphic.  Call
it powerset&lt;T&gt;.</p>

<h2>Tuples<a class="headerlink" href="#tuples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tuple is an ordered collection of elements. The type of elements in
a tuple need not all be be the same. The number of elements in a tuple
is called its <em>arity</em>. Ordered pairs are tuples of arity, <em>2</em>, for
example. A tuple of arity <em>3</em> can be called a (an ordered) <em>triple</em>.
A tuple of a larger arity, <em>n</em>, is called an <em>n-tuple</em>.  The tuple,
<em>(7, X, “house”, square_func)</em>, for example, is a <em>4-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>As is evident in this example, the elements of a tuple are in general
not of the same type, or drawn from the same sets. Here, the first
element is an integer; the second, a variable;, the third, a string;
and last, a function.</p>
<p>An <em>n</em>-tuples should be understood as values taken from a product of
<em>n</em> sets.  If <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are our sets of even numbers between zero
and one hundred, and zero and twenty four, for example, then the
ordered pair, <em>(60,24)</em> is an element of the product set <img class="math" src="_images/math/fd4532a7c98d7c47b7d54737789d6d190f8a7858.png" alt="S
\times T"/>.  The preceding <em>4</em>-tuple would have come from a product of
four sets: one of integers, one of variables, one of strings, and one
of functions.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> of a tuple is the tuple of the types of its elements. In
mathematical writing, we’d say that the tuple, <em>(-3,4)</em> is al element
of the set <img class="math" src="_images/math/d525dd73f25737324d2d392212dacd850ef44d6e.png" alt="{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z},"/> and if asked about
its type, most mathematicians would say <em>pair of integers</em>. In Dafny,
where types are more explicit than they usually are in quasi-formal
mathematical discourse, the type of this tuple is <em>(int, int)</em>. In
general, in both math and in Dafny, in particular, the type of a tuple
in a set product, ::<cite>S_1 times S_2 times ldots time S_n</cite>, where
the types of these sets are <img class="math" src="_images/math/a25f27eaf855f40709db99b90e3b307f237b9c35.png" alt="T_1, \ldots, T_n"/> is <img class="math" src="_images/math/74d9c0565f0b3fbb6fd97c1dd34039045be28627.png" alt="(T_1,
\ldots, T_n)"/>.</p>
<p>The elements of a tuple are sometimes called <em>fields of that tuple.
Given an *n</em>-tuple, <em>t</em>, we are often interested in working with the
value of one of its fields. We thus need a function for <em>projecting</em>
the value of a field out of a tuple. We actually think of an <em>n</em>-tuple
as coming with <em>n</em> projection functions, one for each field.</p>
<p>Projection functions are usually written using the Greek letter,
::<cite>pi</cite>, with a natural number subscript indicating which field a
given projection function ” projects”. Given a <em>4</em>-tuple, <em>t = (7, X,
“house”, square_func)</em>, we would have math::<cite>pi_0(t) = 7</cite> and
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0832133408abb0b5c9d45e6b0fbffe3dd705bd45.png" alt="\pi_3(t) = square_func."/></p>
<p>The type of a projection funcion is <em>function from tuple type to field
type</em>. In general, because tuples have fields of different types, they
will also have projection functions of different types. For example,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/f96bb02fb7101e0965f5d94b111888cbe1914724.png" alt="pi_0"/> here is of type (in Dafny) <img class="math" src="_images/math/312b0afa59f8001e7eda18a2d5eebd4787b37d11.png" alt="(int, variable, string,
int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}"/> while <img class="math" src="_images/math/0dab7d9572fb05154c9fa626fbe6bdaaeccf8fa4.png" alt="pi_3"/> is of
type <img class="math" src="_images/math/2630939c0e41b2205905b6b6ec364d3e0222b2bf.png" alt="(int, variable, string, int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow
(int \rightarrow int)."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, tuples are written as they are in mathematics, as lists of
field values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.  For
example <em>t := (1, “hello”, [1,2,3])” assigns to *t</em> a <em>3-tuple</em> whose
first field has the value, <em>1</em> (of type <em>int</em>); whose second field has
the value, “hello”, a string; and whose third element is the list of
integers, <em>[2, 4, 6]</em>.</p>
<p>Projection in Dafny is accomplished using the <em>tuple</em> subscripting (as
opposed to array or list subscripting) operation. Tuple subscripting is
done by putting a dot (period) followed by an index after the tuple
expression. Here’s a little Dafny code to illustrate. It defines <em>t</em>
to be the triple, <em>(7, ‘X’, “hello”)</em> (of type <em>(int, char, string)</em>),
and then usses the <em>.0</em> and <em>.2</em> projection functions to project the
first and third elements of the tuple, which it prints. To make the
type of the tuple explicit, the final line of code declare <em>t’</em> to be
the same tuple value, but this time explicitly declares its type.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var t := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
print t.0;
print t.2;
var t&#39;: (int, char, string) := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While all of this might seem a little abstract, it’s actually simple
and very useful. Any table of data, such as a table with columns that
hold names, birthdays, and social security numbers, represents data in
a product set. Each row is a tuple. The columns correspond to the sets
from which the field values are drawn. One set is a set of names; the
second, a set birthdays; the third, a set of social security numbers.
Each row is just a particular tuple in product of these three sets,
and the table as a whole is what we call a <em>relation</em>. If you have
heard of a <em>relational database</em>, you now know what kind of data such
a system handles: tables, i.e., <em>relations</em>.</p>
