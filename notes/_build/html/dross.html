of Einstein in physics, proved once and for all that there is no such
algorithm.</p>
<p>It should not be surprising to learn, then, that Dafny can’t prove
every provable proposition about programs. In fact, Dafny, and all
program verifiers, are fundamentally limited in what they can prove.
Sometimes what they need is some help.</p>

<p>definitions, consider the factorial function and an implementation of
this function in the functional <em>sub-language</em> of Dafny. (Dafny
provides sub-languages for specification and for both functional and
imperative programming.)</p>
<p>The factorial function is defined recursively. For any natural
(non-negative whole) number, <em>n, factorial(n)</em> is defined by two
cases: one for when <em>n</em> is zero, and one for any other value of
<em>n</em>.</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/414dc4542e5b8c1f42d7fe32cfecfd1d4526d4e3.png" alt="f(x)= \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \text{if $x&lt;0$}.\\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}"/></p>
</div><p>First, if <em>n = 0</em> (called the <em>base case</em>) then <em>factorial(n)</em> is
defined to be 1. Otherwise, for any <em>n</em> where <em>n &gt; 0)</em>, <em>factorial(n)</em>
is defined recursively as <em>n * factorial(n-1)</em>. This is what we call
the <em>recursive</em> case. By recursive, we mean that the function is used
in its own definition.</p>
<p>Recursive definitions are ubiquitous in mathematics. In fact, if you
get right down to it, most every function you’ve ever thought about is
defined recursively. For example, the addition of two natural
(non-negative) numbers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> is defined recursively. If <em>m = 0</em>,
the base case, then the answer is <em>n</em>. If (m&gt;0), the recursive case,
then there is some natural number <em>m’</em>, the <em>predecessor</em> of <em>m</em>, and
in this case the result is one more than (the successor of) the sum of
<em>m’</em> and <em>n</em>. such that <em>m = m’+1</em>. Recursion is thus fundamentally a
mathematical and not (just) a computational concept.</p>
<p>The reason that such definitions makes sense, and are not just endless
self loops, is that they are <em>well-founded</em>.  What this means is that
for any given <em>n</em> (a natural number), no matter how large, the looping
eventually ends. For example, <em>fact(3)</em> is defined to be <em>3 *
fact(2).</em> Expanding the definition of the recursive call to the
<em>fact This is *3 * (2 * fact(1)).  This in turn is *3
* 2 * 1 * fact(0).</em> Because <em>fact(0)</em> is a base case,
defined to be just <em>1</em> without any further recursion, the recursion
terminates, and the end result is <em>3 * 2 * 1 * 1</em>, which finally
evalutes to <em>6</em>. o matter how large <em>n</em> is, eventually (in a finite
number of steps), the recursion will bottom out at the base case, and
a result will be produced.</p>
<p>Our functional program to compute the factorial function mirrors the
abstract mathematical definition. The program, like the definition, is
recursive: it is defined in terms of (by calling)  itself. Here’s the code
in Dafny’s functional programming sub-language.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>function fact(n: int): int
  requires n &gt;= 0 // for recursion to be well founded
{
  if (n==0)
  then 1
  else n * fact(n-1)
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The program takes a value, <em>n</em>, of type int (any integer). Then the
requires <em>predicate</em> (a piece of logical specification) restricts the
value of <em>n</em> to be non-negative. Finally you have the recursive rules
for computing the value of the function. If <em>n</em> is zero the result is
one otherwise it’s <em>n</em> times the function itself applied to <em>n-1</em>.</p>
<p>So here you have something very interesting. First, the code is just
like the mathematics. Functional programming languages are not nearly
as expressive as predicate logic (as we’ll see when we really get to
logic and proofs), but they are much closer to mathematics, in many
cases, than imperative code. Programs in pure functional languages are
more expressive and easier (for humans and machines) to reason about
than programs written in imperative languages.</p>
<p>Second, we now see the integration of logic and code, The <em>requires</em>
predicate is a logical proposition <em>about</em> the value of the parameter,
<em>n</em>, expressed not as a comment but as a formal and machine-checkable
part of the program.</p>
<p>Although you can’t see it here in this document, Dafny checks to
ensure that no code ever calls this function with a value of <em>n</em> that
is less than zero, <em>and</em> it proves to itself that the recursion is
well founded.  That is a lot more than you could ever expect to get
programming in an imperative language like Python.</p>
<p>Pure functional programming languages thus provide a way to program
functions almost as if in pure mathematics. At the same time, such
programs can be run reasonably efficiently and analyzed by human and
machanized checkers.</p>
<p>So what’s the downside? Why not always program in such languages?  One
reason is efficiency. It’s a challenge to get programs in such
languages to execute efficiency precisely because there is no notion
of a mutable memory. There’s thus not way (conceptually) to update a
part of a large data structure; rather one must write a function that
takes a given data structure and that computes and builds a whole new
one, even if it differs from a given data structure only a little.</p>
<p>A second, even more fundamental limitation, is that there is no
concept of interacting with an external environment in the realm of
pure functions. You’ve got data values and functions that transform
given values into new values, and that’s it. You simply cannot do I/O
in a pure functional language! There are functional languages that are
meant for practical programming (such as Haskell), in which you can of
course do I/O, but the capabilities to do I/O are non-functional. They
are in a sense <em>bolted on</em>. They are bolted on in clever, clean ways,
but the fact remains that I/O is just not a functional concept.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="to-integrate">
<h1>To integrate<a class="headerlink" href="#to-integrate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fitting-it-all-together">
<h1>Fitting it All Together<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-it-all-together" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So as we go forward, here’s what we’ll see. Ultimately, for purposes
of efficiency and interactivity (I/O), we will write imperative code
to implement software systems. That said, we can often use functional
code to implement subroutines that perform computations that do not
require mutable storage or I/O. We will <em>also</em> use pure functional
programs as parts of <em>specifications</em>.</p>
<p>For example, we might specify that an <em>imperative</em> implementation of
the factorial function must take any natural number <em>n</em> as an argument
and return the value of <em>fact(n),</em> our <em>functional</em> program for the
factorial function. The logical specification of the imperative
program will be an <em>implication</em> stating that if a proper argument is
presented, a correct result <em>as defined by a functional program</em> will
be produced.</p>
<p>We can thus use pure functional programs both for computation <em>when
appropriate</em>, yielding certain benefits in terms of understandability
and safety, and as elements in logical specifications of imperative
code. In Dafny, a pure functional program that is intended only for
use in specifications is declared as a <em>function</em>. A pure functional
program intended to be called from imperative code is declared as a
<em>function method.</em> Imperative programs are simply declared as methods.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We’ll see some of what’s involved as we go forward in this class. We
will also eventually dive in to understand what proofs even are, and
why in general they are hard to construct.  Before we go there,
though, let’s have some fun and learn how to write imperative code in
Dafny.</p>
<p>==</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div>include “functional.dfy”
module imperative {
import opened functional</div></blockquote>
<p>We start by prepending the function.dfy file to this one, as the
compiler needs the definitions in both files to work. We enclose the
definitions in this file in a module called <em>imperative</em>. And we
import and open the functional module in the functional.dfy file.  To
import them makes them available in this file. Opening the module
means we don’t need to use the module name as a prefix to use them.</p>
<p>Now we give a typical imperative program for computing the factorial
function. The program takes any natural number, <em>n</em>, and returns an
answer in <em>f</em>. The value of <em>f</em> is computed first by case analysis.
If <em>n</em> is zero, the correct result, <em>1</em>, is returned. Otherwise, in
the case where <em>n &gt; 0</em>, we <em>loop</em> to compute the factorial of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>We set a variable, <em>a</em> (for <em>accumulator</em>) to <em>1</em>. Each time through
the loop we will multiply a by a value, $i$, that decreases from n to
1 as the loop runs. The loop is guaranteed to terminate in a finite
number of steps because one can only decrement a natural number value,
<em>i</em>, a finite number of times before it reaches <em>0</em>, at which point
the loop stops.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
// For any n, return the factorial of n
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    var i: nat := n;
    var a: nat := 1;
    while (i !=  0)
    {
        a := a * n;
        i := i - 1;
    }
    return a;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We have documented the specification informally in a comment akin to
the “doc strings” one uses to document Python program specifications.
The problem with this approach is that there’s no practical way to
check the code against the specification expressed in the comment.
The problem with this <em>code</em> is that actually has an error, bug. Read
it carefull to see if you can find the bug before you go on. You can
see that there’s a major error jst smoke testing the program. Give it
a try.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Indeed, natural science is based to a considerable extent on inductive
reasoning. Observations in the form of tests of hypotheses are taken
as evidence in support of hypotheses about how the world works. When
there is a sufficient body of evidence, a hypothesis is elevated to a
theory.  Statistical techniques are often used to quanitfy remaining
doubt.  Theories are always subject to falsification in principle,
though in practice the evidence for some theories is so strong that
for all intents and purposes, some questions are all but settled, and
acting on alternative hypotheses would be irrational.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A Syntax for Boolean Expressions</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>How can we precisely and concisely specify the entire (infinite) set
of well formed Boolean expressions? In this section, we will find an
answer in the concept of <em>inductive definitions</em>, which are closely
related to recursive functions.</p>
<p>We’ll define what it means to be a Boolean expression using several
cases, some of which will explain how to form larger such expressions
from smaller ones, ad infinitum. So here we go.</p>
<p>Case #1: Literal Expressions. For each Boolean value, <em>b</em> (<em>0 or 1</em>)
we have a corresponding Boolean expression, <em>Lit(b)</em>. So far, then, we
have just two Boolean expressions: <em>Lit(true)</em> and <em>Lit(false)</em>. We
can think of <em>Lit</em> as a kind of function that takes a Boolean value
and that constructs a Boolean expression from it.</p>
<p>Case #2: Boolean Variables. We will assume that we have some set of
<em>Boolean variables</em>. For simplicity, let’s assume that this set is
<img class="math" src="_images/math/d3e24597e650be52a06c04034ccdfd94b5b0eb59.png" alt="\{ P, Q, R \}"/>. For each variable, $V$, we have a corresponding
Boolean expression, $BVar(V)$. Now we have three more expressions,
<em>BVar(P)$, *BVar(Q)</em> and <em>BVar(R)</em>.</p>
<p>First, we will
define two <em>literal</em> expressions, one for each of the two Boolean
values. We will call them <em>BLit(0)</em> and <em>BLit(1)</em>.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
For each kind of expression we will also need a way to <em>evaluate</em> it:
to say what Boolean value it evaluates to. For this, we will define a
function that (for now) takes a Boolean <em>expression</em> as an argument
and that returns a Boolean <em>value</em> as a result. We will call this
evaluation function for Boolean expressions <em>beval</em>.</p>
<p>Now we need to explain how this function behaves for each of the kinds
of Boolean expressions we have defined do far. This is an easy one. We
will define <em>beval(BLit(0))</em> to evaluate to <em>0</em>, and <em>beval(BLit(1))</em>
to evaluate to <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>Boolean logic is named after its inventor, George Boole,
the British philosopher, mathematician, and logician.</p>
<p>Dafny supports a range of abstract data types akin to those found in
widely used, industrial imperative programming languages and systems,
such as Python and Java. In this chapter, we introduce and briefly
illustrate the use of these types. The types we discuss are as follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bool, supporting Boolean algebra</li>
<li>int, nat, and real types, supporting <em>exact</em> arithmetic (unlike
the numerical types found in most industrial languages</li>
<li>char, supporting character types</li>
<li>set&lt;T&gt; and iset&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic set theory for finite and infinite sets</li>
<li>seq&lt;T&gt; and iseq&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic finite and infinite sequences</li>
<li>string, supporting character sequences (with addtional helpful functions)</li>
<li>map&lt;K,V&gt; and imap&lt;K,V&gt;, polymorphic finite and infinite partial functions</li>
<li>array&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic 1- and multi-dimensional arrays</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrays, objects (class instances), and traits (to be discussed) are of
“reference” types, which is to say, values of these types are stored
on the heap. Values of other types, including sets and sequences, are
of “value types,” which is to say values of these types are stored on
the stack; and they’re thus always treated as “local” variables. They
are passed by value, not reference, when passed as arguments to
functions and methods. Value types include the basic scalar types
(bool, char, nat, int, real), built-in collection types (set,
multiset, seq, string, map, imap), tuple, inductive, and co-inductive
types (to be discussed).  Reference type values are allocated
dynamically on the heap, are passed by reference, and therefore can be
“side effected” (mofified) by methods to which they are passed.</p>

<p>The problem of deciding <em>efficiently</em> whether there is a combination
of Boolean variable values that makes any given Boolean expression
true is the most important unsolved problem in computer science. We
currently do not know of a solution that with runtime complexity that
is better than exponential the number of variables in an expression.
It’s easy to determine whether an assignment of values to variables
does the trick: just evaluate the expression with those values for the
variables. But <em>finding</em> such a combination today requires, for the
hardest of these problems, trying all :math:<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2^n</span></code> combinations of
Boolean values for <em>n</em> variables.</p>
<p>At the same time, we do not know that there is <em>not</em> a more efficient
algorithm. Many experts would bet that there isn’t one, but until we
know for sure, there is a tantalizing possibility that someone someday
will find an <em>efficient decision procedure</em> for Boolean satisfiability.</p>
<p>To close this exploration of computational complexity theory, we’ll
just note that we solved an instances of another related problem: not
only to determine whether there is at least one (whether <em>there
exists</em>) at least one combination of variable values that makes the
expression true, but further determining how many different ways there
are to do it.</p>
<p>Researchers and advanced practitioners of logic and computation
sometimes use the word <em>model</em> to refer to a combination of variable
values that makes an expression true. The problem of finding a Boolean
expression that <em>satisfies</em> a Boolean formula is thus somtetimes
called the <em>model finding</em> problem. By contrast, the problem of
determining how many ways there are to satisfy a Boolean expression is
called the <em>model counting</em> problem.</p>
<p>Solutions to these problems have a vast array of practical uses.  As
one still example, many logic puzzles can be represented as Boolean
expressions, and a model finder can be used to determine whether there
are any “solutions”, if so, what one solution is.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>How hard is the model finding problem? Is it even <em>decidable</em> in
theory?  That is, is there an algorithm that can solve any instance of
the problem? Given any Boolean expressions, such an algorithm in a
finite number of steps would either find a model or determine and
report that there is no model that the expression is <em>unsatisfiable</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is actually decidable. To see this one need only note that
there is a finite number of interpretations for a Boolean expression
with a finite number, <em>n</em>, namely <img class="math" src="_images/math/798d39775b3c54beddeb31ad508597409e6e7c43.png" alt="2^n"/>. That is, the number of
interpretations is <em>exponential in the number of variables</em>. To see
that this is so, consider that there are two interpretation if there
is one variable (the first sets the variable to true, the second, to
false). For each of those two, there are then two values for a second
variable, for a total of four interpretations. For each of those four,
there are two values of a third variable, making eight interpretations
for three variables. Each time one adds one more variable, the number
of interpretations <em>doubles</em>. This is an example of exponential
growth.</p>
<p>In computer science, we often use Boolean expressions, with variables,
to specify properties that we require hold for certain objects. For a
property to hold, the negation of the property must not hold. But if
there is a model of the negation of a property, then there is a case
in which the property does <em>not</em> hold. The problem of checking to see
if there is a model of the negation of a desired property is called
the <em>model checking</em> problem. Model checking is a vitally important
process in many areas of computer science.</p>
<p>The formulation of these problems is simple, but the problems are not
computationally simple at all. They remain foci of intense research
and are central the most important unresolved mystery in all computer
science: whether there is an <em>efficient</em> algorithm the model finding
problem.</p>
<p>In the rest of this chapter, we will make these idea precise by
actually implementing them in Dafny.</p>
<p>, we will present a Dafny function that
when given a Boolean expression in our little language returns the
set of variables that appear in that expression.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here we are focused on constructors. To make the distinction clear,
we will use the names <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>not</em>, and so forth for Boolean
operators, and the related names, <em>bNotExp, bAndExp, bOrExp</em>, etc.,
for the corresponding expression constructors.</p>
<p>Again, each constructor takes one or more Boolean expressions as its
arguments and yields a larger expression as a result. For example, the
<em>bNotExp</em> constructor takes one expression (such as <em>litFalse</em>) and
yields larger expression, here, <em>bNotExp(litFalse)</em>. The <em>bOrExp</em>
constructor takes two expression as arguments, e.g., <em>litTrue</em> and
<em>litFalse</em>, yielding the term, <em>bOrExp(litTrue,litFalse)</em>. Finally,
the <em>bAndExp</em> constructor take two expressions, such as the two we
just constructed, and yields the term, <em>bAndExp(bOrExp(litTrue,
litFalse), bNotExp(listFalse))</em>. This expression could in turn be an
argument to a constructor that would build an ever larger one.</p>
<p>However, we’re not limited to building larger expressions only from
<em>literal</em> expressions. Given any two expressions, no matter how big
they already are, we can use them to build a larger expression.  So,
for example, we can also build the expression, <em>(true || false) &amp;&amp;
(!false)</em>. All inductive definitions work this way. One provides a set
of base cases for the type of expression being considered, along with
ways of combining any smaller <em>expressions</em> into larger ones of the
same kind.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Now it should be clear when we say colloquially that a program
<em>computes a function or a relation</em>. Whenever it is given a valid
argument representing the <em>first</em> value of a pair in the relation, it
computes a <em>second</em> value such that the pair, <img class="math" src="_images/math/f740fbbb0fac5ec5c0233d4402773184a07ddd90.png" alt="(first, second)"/>
is in the given relation. When we say, for example, that a program
<em>computes the factorial function</em>, we mean that if we give it a
non-negative number, <em>n</em>, it returns a number <em>m</em> such that the pair
<em>(n,m)</em> is <em>in</em> the relation. And for <em>(n,m)</em> to be in the relation it
must be that <img class="math" src="_images/math/ecefb159f55afb2d10579e24bafdc9448c0a0090.png" alt="m = fact(n)"/>. Given, <em>n</em>, such a program thus has
to return <img class="math" src="_images/math/81d4171a788af9ec16c0d560ce8574dbc60fd5da.png" alt="fact(n)"/>. A program that computes a <em>function</em> is
deterministic, in the sense that it can return at most one result:
because there is at most one result.</p>
<p>A method or a function promises to return a value for any
argument of the type that the method is declared to take. But if the
function being implemented is not defined for that value then there is
a problem: what should the method or function return? For example, if
one five a negative number to a function meant to real-valued square
roots, there simply is no right answer.</p>
