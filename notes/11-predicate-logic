11. Sets as Domains: Predicate Logic
************************************

In this chapter we move from propositional to a predicate logic, in
which the values of variables can range not only over :math:{\matbb
B}` but over arbitrary sets. The issue of *validity* is complicated as
it now has to be understood as involving judgements of truth that are
independent of any particular interpretation.
